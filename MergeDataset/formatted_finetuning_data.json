        "Response": "Dark patterns are deceptive design elements used to manipulate users into making purchases or taking certain actions. Here are some examples of dark patterns and how they work:\n\n* \"Confirm shaming\" involves using a phrase or message to create a sense of fear or shame in the user to nudge them into taking a certain action. For example, a platform might use the phrase \"I will stay unsecured\" if a user doesn't include insurance in their cart.\n* \"Forced action\" involves forcing a user to take an action that requires them to buy additional goods or subscribe to an unrelated service. For example, a platform might prohibit a user from continuing with a purchase unless they upgrade to a higher rate or fee.\n* \"Subscription trap\" involves making it difficult for users to cancel a paid subscription or hiding the cancellation option. For example, a platform might make the instructions for cancellation ambiguous or confusing.\n* \"Interface interference\" involves manipulating the user interface to misdirect the user from taking an action as desired. For example, a platform might use a light-colored option for selecting \"No\" in response to a pop-up asking a user if they wish to make a purchase.\n* \"Bait and switch\" involves advertising a particular outcome based on the user's action but deceptively serving an alternate outcome. For example, a seller might offer a quality product at a cheap price but then reveal that the product is no longer available and offer a similar-looking product at a higher price.\n* \"Drip pricing\" involves not revealing the full price of a product or service upfront or revealing the price post-confirmation of purchase. For example, a platform might charge a user a higher price than the amount disclosed at the time of checkout.\n* \"Disguised advertisement\" involves posing advertisements as other types of content, such as user-generated content or news articles. For example, a platform might post an advertisement that looks like a news article to trick users into clicking on it.\n* \"Nagging\" involves disrupting and annoying users with repeated and persistent interactions to effectuate a transaction. For example, a platform might ask a user to download their app again and again.\n* \"Trick Question\" involves using confusing or vague language to misguide or misdirect a user from taking desired action. For example, a platform might use a phrase like \"Do you wish to opt out of receiving updates on our collection and discounts forever?\" with options like \"Yes. I would like to receive updates\" and \"Not Now\".\n* \"Saas billing\" involves generating and collecting payments from consumers on a recurring basis in a software as a service (SaaS) business model by exploiting positive acquisition loops in recurring subscriptions. For example, a platform might not notify a user when a free trial is converted to a paid subscription.\n* \"Rogue Malwares\" involves using ransomware or scareware to mislead or trick users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool. For example, a pirating website might promise free content but actually lead to an embedded malware when the link is accessed.\n\nThese are just a few examples of dark patterns used in online advertising and e-commerce."

        "Instruction": "What are some examples of dark patterns that are prohibited under the Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023, and how do they manipulate users into taking certain actions?",
        "Response": "The Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023, prohibit several types of dark patterns that manipulate users into taking certain actions. Here are some examples:\n\n* \"Confirm shaming\" involves using a phrase, video, audio, or other means to create a sense of fear or shame in the mind of the user to nudge them to act in a certain way. For example, a platform for booking flight tickets might use the phrase \"I will stay unsecured\" when a user does not include insurance in their cart.\n* \"Forced action\" means forcing a user into taking an action that would require them to buy any additional goods or subscribe to an unrelated service. For example, a platform might force a user to download an unintended or unrelated separate app to access a service originally advertised on another app.\n* \"Subscription trap\" refers to the process of making cancellation of a paid subscription impossible or a complex and lengthy process. For example, a platform might hide the cancellation option for a subscription or force a user to provide payment details or authorization for auto-debits for availing a free subscription.\n* \"Interface interference\" means a design element that manipulates the user interface in ways that highlight certain specific information and obscure other relevant information. For example, a platform might design a light-colored option for selecting \"No\" in response to a pop-up asking a user if they wish to make a purchase, or conceal the cancellation symbol in tiny font.\n* \"Bait and switch\" means the practice of advertising a particular outcome based on the user's action but deceptively serving an alternate outcome. For example, a seller might offer a quality product at a cheap price but when the consumer is about to pay or buy, the seller states that the product is no longer available and instead offers a similar-looking product but more expensive.\n* \"Drip pricing\" means a practice whereby elements of prices are not revealed upfront or are revealed surreptitiously within the user experience. For example, a platform might charge an amount higher than the amount disclosed at the time of checkout, or reveal the price post-confirmation of purchase.\n* \"Disguised advertisement\" means a practice of posing, masking advertisements as other types of content such as user-generated content or news articles. For example, a platform might post an advertisement that is designed to blend in with the rest of the interface in order to trick customers into clicking on it.\n* \"Nagging\" means a dark pattern practice due to which a user is disrupted and annoyed by repeated and persistent interactions, in the form of requests, information, options, or interruptions, to effectuate a transaction and make some commercial gains. For example, a website might ask a user to download their app again and again, or a platform might ask users to give their phone numbers or other personal details for supposedly security purposes.\n* \"Trick Question\" means the deliberate use of confusing or vague language like confusing wording, double negatives, or other similar tricks, in order to misguide or misdirect a user from taking desired action. For example, a platform might use a phrase like \"Do you wish to opt out of receiving updates on our collection and discounts forever?\" using phrases like \"Yes. I would like to receive updates\" and \"Not Now\", instead of the option \"Yes\".\n* \"Saas billing\" refers to the process of generating and collecting payments from consumers on a recurring basis in a software as a service (SaaS) business model by exploiting positive acquisition loops in recurring subscriptions to get money from users as surreptitiously as possible. For example, a platform might charge customers for features and services they don't use, or use shady credit card authorization practices to deceive consumers.\n* \"Rogue Malwares\" means using a ransomware or scareware to mislead or trick a user into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on their computer. For example, a pirating website/app might promise the consumer to provide free content but actually lead to an embedded malware when the link is accessed.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the dark patterns prohibited under the Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023. Each of these patterns manipulates users into taking certain actions, often to the benefit of the platform or seller.\n\nWould you like to know more about the Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023?"

This allows the National Commission to correct any mistakes or errors in its previous orders.\n\nSecondly, the National Commission can set aside an ex parte order if an application is made by the aggrieved party (Section 61). This provides a safeguard for parties who may have been unfairly affected by an ex parte order.\n\nRegarding the enforcement of its decisions, the National Commission's orders can be enforced in the same manner as if they were decrees made by a court in a suit before it, with the provisions of Order XXI of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 applying (Section 71). This ensures that the National Commission's orders are given the same weight and authority as court decrees.\n\nHowever, if someone fails to comply with an order made by the National Commission, they can be punishable with imprisonment for a term of at least one month, but not more than three years, or with a fine of at least twenty-five thousand rupees, but not more than one lakh rupees, or with both (Section 72). This serves as a deterrent against non-compliance with the National Commission's orders.\n\nFinally, an appeal can be made against an order of the National Commission to the Supreme Court within thirty days from the date of the order (Section 67). However, the Supreme Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period.\n\nWould you like to know more about the Consumer Protection Act 2019?"

        "Response": "According to the Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023-7-11.pdf, some examples of dark patterns in advertising include:\n\n* \"Confirm shaming\": using phrases or videos to create fear or shame in the user's mind to nudge them into acting in a certain way. For example, a platform using the phrase \"I will stay unsecured\" when a user does not include insurance in their cart.\n* \"Forced action\": forcing a user to take an action that requires them to buy additional goods or subscribe to an unrelated service. For example, prohibiting a user from continuing with the use of a product or service unless they upgrade for a higher rate or fees.\n* \"Subscription trap\": making cancellation of a paid subscription impossible or complex. For example, hiding the cancellation option for a subscription or forcing a user to provide payment details or authorization for auto-debits for availing a free subscription.\n* \"Interface interference\": designing a user interface that manipulates the user into taking an action as desired. For example, designing a light-colored option for selecting \"No\" in response to a pop-up asking a user if they wish to make a purchase.\n* \"Bait and switch\": advertising a particular outcome based on the user's action but deceptively serving an alternate outcome. For example, a seller offering a quality product at a cheap price but when the consumer is about to pay or buy, the seller states that the product is no longer available and instead offers a similar-looking product but more expensive.\n* \"Drip pricing\": revealing elements of prices surreptitiously within the user experience or revealing the price post-confirmation of purchase. For example, a consumer booking a flight, the online platform showcases the price as X at the checkout page, and when payment is being made, price Y (which is more than X) has been charged by the platform to the consumer.\n* \"Disguised advertisement\": posing, masking advertisements as other types of content such as user-generated content or news articles or false advertisements. For example, a seller or advertiser posting content on a platform that is designed to blend in with the rest of the interface in order to trick customers into clicking on them.\n* \"Nagging\": disrupting and annoying users by repeated and persistent interactions to effectuate a transaction and make some commercial gains. For example, websites asking a user to download their app, again and again.\n* \"Trick Question\": using confusing or vague language to misguide or misdirect a user from taking desired action. For example, while giving a choice to opt, \"Do you wish to opt out of receiving updates on our collection and discounts forever?\" using phrases like, \"Yes. I would like to receive updates\" and \"Not Now\", instead of the option, \"Yes\".\n* \"Saas billing\": generating and collecting payments from consumers on a recurring basis in a software as a service (SaaS) business model by exploiting positive acquisition loops in recurring subscriptions. For example, no notification is given to the user when a free trial is converted to paid.\n* \"Rogue Malwares\": using ransomware or scareware to mislead or trick users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on their computer. For example, when a pirating website/app promises the consumer to provide free content (audio or audio-visual or others) but actually leads to an embedded malware when the link is accessed.\n\nThese are just a few examples of dark patterns in advertising and how they deceive or manipulate consumers into making certain choices or taking specific actions."

This can lead to users making impulse purchases or taking actions they did not intend to take.\n\n\"Basket sneaking\" can be used to add additional items to a user's purchase without their consent, such as by automatically adding paid ancillary services or subscriptions to the cart. This can result in users paying more than they intended to pay for a product or service.\n\n\"Phony malware\" can be used to trick users into believing that their computer is infected with a virus and paying for fake malware removal tools that actually install malware on their computer. This can result in users losing money or having their personal data compromised.\n\nOverall, these dark patterns can have serious consequences for consumers, and it is essential to prohibit them to protect consumer rights and prevent unfair trade practices."
