{"question": "What can a buyer do if the seller ignores a complaint?", "answer": "They can file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "What should I do if a company sells me a defective product?", "answer": "Case Summary:\n\nYou have purchased a product that turned out to be defective, and you are seeking guidance on how to resolve the issue.\n\nCase Type:\n\nConsumer Law, Defective Goods\n\nLegal Provisions:\n\nThe Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides a strong framework to protect your rights. Key provisions include:\n\n- **Section 2(10) - \"Defect\":** This defines a defect as any fault, imperfection, or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, potency, purity, or standard of a product.\n- **Section 2(47) - \"Unfair Trade Practice\":** Supplying defective goods is considered an unfair trade practice, and you have the right to seek redressal against it.\n- **Section 2(9) - Consumer Rights:** This includes the right to be protected against the marketing of goods which are hazardous to life and property and the right to be informed about the quality and purity of the goods.\n\nLegal Remedies:\n\nTo address the issue of receiving a defective product, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Contact the Seller/Manufacturer:** Your first step should be to contact the seller or the manufacturer. Explain the defect clearly, provide proof of purchase (invoice/bill), and request a replacement, repair, or a full refund as per the warranty terms.\n\n2.  **Send a Written Complaint/Email:** If verbal communication doesn't work, send a formal written complaint via email or registered post. Clearly state the problem, the resolution you expect, and a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 15 days) for them to respond.\n\n3.  **Send a Legal Notice:** If you do not receive a satisfactory response, you can have a lawyer send a formal legal notice. This often prompts companies to resolve the issue to avoid litigation.\n\n4.  **File a Complaint in Consumer Court:** If the seller still fails to provide a remedy, you can file a complaint with the appropriate Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. You can do this yourself or through a lawyer. Complaints can now be filed electronically through the E-Daakhil portal.\n\nPractical Advice:\n\n- **Preserve Evidence:** Keep the defective product in its original condition as much as possible. Take clear photos and videos of the defect. Keep all receipts, invoices, warranty cards, and communication records with the seller.\n- **Document Everything:** Maintain a log of all your interactions, including dates, times, names of people you spoke to, and what was discussed.\n- **Check Warranty Terms:** Review the warranty card to understand your rights regarding repair, replacement, or refund.\n\nActing promptly and documenting every step is crucial for building a strong case. The law ensures that you are not left with a faulty product and are entitled to a fair resolution.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Consumer Protection Act, 2019", "Unfair Trade Practice", "Warranty", "Legal Notice", "Consumer Court"]}
{"question": "I bought a product from a company in another state online. Where can I file a consumer complaint if it's defective?", "answer": "You can file a complaint in the Consumer Commission located where you live or work. Under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, jurisdiction is consumer-friendly. The place where the seller is located does not prevent you from filing a case in your own city, as part of the transaction (like payment or delivery) happened there.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Consumer Protection Act, 2019", "Cause of Action"]}
{"question": "I paid for goods with a cheque, but they were defective. Can I just tell my bank to stop the payment?", "answer": "Yes, you can instruct your bank to stop payment on a cheque if the goods are defective. However, the seller can still file a case against you under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. You will then have to prove in court that the goods were genuinely defective and that you had a valid reason to stop the payment. You must have strong evidence of the defects.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Section 138", "Defective Goods", "Stop Payment"]}
{"question": "The seller is refusing to accept my return, saying I should have checked the item at delivery. What are my rights?", "answer": "Under the Sale of Goods Act, a buyer has the right to a reasonable opportunity to examine goods to see if they conform to the contract. While it is good practice to inspect items on delivery, you are not always required to do so on the spot, especially for latent defects that are not immediately obvious. If a defect is discovered later, you can still claim your rights under the warranty or the Consumer Protection Act.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Right to Examine", "Latent Defect", "Warranty"]}
{"question": "What kind of proof do I need to show that a product I received is defective?", "answer": "To prove a product is defective, you need solid evidence. This can include photos and videos of the defect, communication with the seller (emails, letters), reports from an expert or certified technician, and any complaints from other customers if available. Merely stating the product is defective without evidence is often not enough to win a case.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Evidence", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller has taken back defective goods from me before but is now refusing. Does this help my case?", "answer": "Yes, if a seller has a history or habit of accepting returns and issuing credit notes for defective goods, it can support your claim that the current refusal is unfair. This past conduct can be presented as evidence to show an established practice between you and the seller, making your claim for the current defective product stronger.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Course of Dealing", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "The seller's invoice mentions a warranty, but we never signed a separate warranty agreement. Is the invoice warranty valid?", "answer": "Yes, if the warranty terms are printed on the invoice and you have accepted the goods and the invoice without objection, those terms are generally considered part of the sales contract. By accepting the transaction, you implicitly agree to its stated terms, including the warranty conditions.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Invoice", "Terms and Conditions", "Contract"]}
{"question": "Only a few items in my bulk order were defective. Do I still have to pay the seller?", "answer": "You are generally liable to pay for the non-defective goods you received and accepted. For the defective items, you can seek a replacement, repair, or a refund/credit note from the seller. It is crucial to prove which specific goods were defective and their value to justify withholding that portion of the payment.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Partial Defect", "Liability", "Credit Note"]}
{"question": "My cheque to a seller bounced. Can I argue in court that the goods were defective and I didn't owe the money?", "answer": "Yes, claiming that the goods were defective is a valid defense in a cheque bounce case under the Negotiable Instruments Act. However, the burden of proof will be on you to convince the court that the goods were indeed faulty and that this discharged you from the liability to pay. You must provide strong evidence of the defects.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Section 138", "Defective Goods", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller sued me for non-payment, but their goods were faulty and caused me losses. Can I sue them back in the same case?", "answer": "Yes, if a seller sues you for payment, you can file a 'counter-claim' in the same lawsuit for the damages you suffered due to their defective goods. This allows the court to hear both claims together and decide the final amount owed by either party after setting off the claims against each other.", "legal_terms": ["Counter-claim", "Set-off", "Defective Goods", "Damages"]}
{"question": "I've been telling the seller about the defective product on the phone, but they ignore me. Is that enough?", "answer": "While phone calls are a start, they are difficult to prove. It is highly recommended to communicate your complaint in writing, such as through email or a registered letter. A written record is crucial evidence to show that you formally notified the seller about the defect and gave them an opportunity to resolve it. Courts give more weight to written communication.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Written Communication", "Defective Goods", "Complaint"]}
{"question": "The seller claims I accepted the goods because their representative inspected them before shipping. But the goods are defective. What can I do?", "answer": "Even if a pre-shipment inspection was done, you may still have rights, especially if the defects were 'latent' (not discoverable by a normal inspection). If the inspection was limited in scope and couldn't have revealed the internal flaws, you can argue that you did not lose your right to reject the goods or claim damages upon discovering the defects after delivery.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Inspection", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "I gave a seller a signed blank cheque as security for future purchases. Now they have filled an amount and presented it, even though I have issues with the goods. Is this legal?", "answer": "While providing a blank cheque is risky, the law presumes it was issued for a legally enforceable debt. If the seller presents it, the burden is on you to prove it was only for security and that no such debt exists due to defective goods or other issues. If you cannot prove this, you could be held liable under the Negotiable Instruments Act.", "legal_terms": ["Blank Cheque", "Security", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Legally Enforceable Debt", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "What happens if a seller of defective goods doesn't have a registered office in my city?", "answer": "You can still file a suit against the seller in your city if a part of the cause of action, such as placing the order, receiving the goods, or making payment, occurred there. The seller's location is not the only factor for determining jurisdiction.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Civil Procedure Code"]}
{"question": "A product I bought has rusted, but it's meant to be used with water. Is this a defect?", "answer": "Yes, if a product like a sprinkler, which is intended for use with water, rusts quickly, it is considered defective. The product is not of merchantable quality as it fails to meet the basic standard expected for its intended use.", "legal_terms": ["Defect", "Merchantable Quality", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "I bought something from a company that was later sold to another company. Who is responsible for the warranty?", "answer": "When a business is sold, its assets and liabilities, including receivables and warranty obligations, are often transferred to the new owner. The new company (the successor-in-interest) would typically be responsible for honoring the warranty for products sold by the original company.", "legal_terms": ["Successor-in-interest", "Business Transfer Agreement", "Warranty", "Liability"]}
{"question": "How long is a warranty valid if the purchase order just says '14 months' without a start date?", "answer": "Generally, if a warranty period is mentioned, it is interpreted to run from the date of sale from the seller to you (the immediate buyer). It does not usually start from the date you resell it to an end consumer, as the seller has no control or knowledge of that subsequent sale.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty Period", "Date of Sale", "Contract Interpretation"]}
{"question": "Can I claim storage costs for keeping defective goods that the seller won't take back?", "answer": "Claiming storage costs for defective goods is difficult. Such claims are often considered claims for damages rather than warranty claims. To succeed, you must prove there was a breach of contract, a direct loss because of it, and a causal link. Courts may not entertain such claims if not explicitly covered in your agreement.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Breach of Contract", "Warranty Claim"]}
{"question": "The seller sent me an email admitting I owe a certain amount after deducting for some returned goods. Can I use this as proof?", "answer": "Yes, a written communication like an email from the seller confirming a balance due after adjustments for defective returns can be used as a strong piece of evidence. It serves as an admission of liability for the returned goods and helps establish the outstanding amount.", "legal_terms": ["Admission of Liability", "Evidence", "Reconciliation of Accounts"]}
{"question": "A seller is suing me for non-payment, but they haven't provided a statement of account. How does this affect their case?", "answer": "In a suit for recovery of money, the absence of a statement of account or other sufficient documentary evidence makes it very difficult for the seller to prove their claim. Without clear computation and proof, a court may not grant the full amount claimed by the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Statement of Account", "Burden of Proof", "Documentary Evidence"]}
{"question": "My customer is holding back payment because the goods I sold them were defective. Can I claim this loss from my supplier?", "answer": "Yes, you can claim this as a loss. However, you must prove that the goods from your supplier were indeed defective, that you supplied these specific goods to your customer, and that the customer's non-payment is a direct result of the defects. You need to provide invoices and communication to link the entire chain of events.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Defective Goods", "Causation", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "I am being sued, and the other party is using my company's old balance sheet against me. Is that allowed?", "answer": "Yes, balance sheets and other financial documents can be used as evidence in court. If a balance sheet shows an amount due to a creditor (the other party), it can be seen as an admission of debt. You would need to provide strong reasons to dispute that entry.", "legal_terms": ["Balance Sheet", "Evidence", "Admission of Debt", "Sundry Creditors"]}
{"question": "I issued a debit note to my supplier for defective goods, but they claim they never received it. What should I do?", "answer": "Simply issuing a debit note is not enough; you must prove that the supplier received it. Without proof of receipt (like a signed delivery confirmation or an email read-receipt), the supplier can deny it, and the court may not consider the debit note as a valid adjustment against your dues.", "legal_terms": ["Debit Note", "Proof of Receipt", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods in an international 'FOB' contract. Can I still reject them after they arrive in my country?", "answer": "Yes. In an FOB (Free on Board) contract, while the risk passes to you once the goods are on the ship, you retain the right to inspect and reject them upon arrival if they are defective. The FOB term primarily deals with risk during transit, not the fundamental quality of the goods.", "legal_terms": ["FOB Contract", "Sale of Goods Act", "Right to Reject", "Inspection"]}
{"question": "How are damages calculated if I receive defective goods under an FOB contract?", "answer": "Generally, damages are the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods at the port of shipment on the date of breach. However, if the seller knew the goods were for resale at a specific destination (like the US), the court may consider the market price at that destination for calculating damages.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "FOB Contract", "Market Price", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "The supplier's inspector (SGS) checked the goods before they were shipped, but they still turned out to be defective. Can the supplier deny responsibility?", "answer": "No. A pre-shipment inspection certificate is not always conclusive proof of quality. If the inspection was limited or could not have revealed latent (hidden) defects, the supplier remains liable for breach of warranty. The inspector's certificate does not relieve the seller of their contractual obligation to supply goods of the agreed quality.", "legal_terms": ["Pre-shipment Inspection", "Latent Defect", "Warranty", "SGS Certificate"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods and had to sell them at a lower 'salvage' price. Can I claim the difference from the supplier?", "answer": "Yes. The measure of damages for defective goods is typically the difference between what the goods would have been worth if they were not defective (market value) and the price you actually got for them (salvage value). You can sue the supplier to recover this loss.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Salvage Value", "Market Value", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My supplier failed to deliver a second lot of goods after I complained about the first lot being defective. Can I claim damages for the non-delivery?", "answer": "Yes, if you have a concluded contract for the second lot. The supplier cannot refuse to supply the second lot just because you raised a genuine complaint about the first. Their failure to deliver the second lot would be a separate breach of contract for which you can claim damages.", "legal_terms": ["Breach of Contract", "Non-delivery", "Damages", "Concluded Contract"]}
{"question": "I tried to settle my cheque bounce case by offering to pay, but the other party refused. What happens now?", "answer": "A cheque bounce case under Section 138 of the NI Act can only be compounded (settled) with the consent of both parties. If the complainant does not agree to your settlement offer, the court cannot force them to accept it. The trial will proceed, and the court will decide the case on its merits.", "legal_terms": ["Compounding of Offence", "Section 138", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Settlement"]}
{"question": "The court convicted me in a cheque bounce case. Can the punishment be just a fine instead of jail time?", "answer": "Yes. For an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act, the court can sentence you to a fine, imprisonment, or both. Courts often prioritize compensating the complainant and may impose a fine (up to twice the cheque amount) as the primary punishment, with imprisonment only if the fine is not paid.", "legal_terms": ["Sentence", "Section 138", "Fine", "Compensation"]}
{"question": "A business partner gave me an undated security cheque. He says the goods were defective. Can I fill in the date and deposit it?", "answer": "Yes, you can fill in the date on an undated cheque. The law presumes it was given for a valid debt. If the cheque is dishonored, the issuer has to prove in court that there was no existing liability at that time because the goods were defective. The burden of proof is on him.", "legal_terms": ["Undated Cheque", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Burden of Proof", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My employee made a note on an invoice that goods were defective. Can this be used as evidence against my company?", "answer": "Yes, a note made by your employee (like a salesman) on an official document like an invoice can be used as evidence. It suggests that your company was aware of the defects at that time. It's an important piece of evidence for the buyer.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Invoice", "Admission", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I didn't file a written complaint about defective goods, but I told the delivery person. Is that sufficient?", "answer": "Telling the delivery person is not sufficient. You must formally communicate the defect to the seller or an authorized representative of the company. A court is unlikely to accept a conversation with a driver or a junior employee as a valid notification of defect. Always communicate in writing.", "legal_terms": ["Notification of Defect", "Complaint", "Evidence", "Written Communication"]}
{"question": "The cheque I gave for a purchase bounced. I had already paid a part of the amount in cash before the cheque was presented. Is the case valid?", "answer": "The case may not be valid. If you make a part-payment after issuing a cheque but before it's presented, the legally enforceable debt is reduced. The payee should endorse the part-payment on the cheque and present it for the balance amount only. Presenting it for the full original amount when a lesser amount is due is not permissible under law.", "legal_terms": ["Part-Payment", "Section 56 NI Act", "Legally Enforceable Debt", "Endorsement"]}
{"question": "The seller is charging interest on delayed payments, but we never signed an agreement for it. Is this allowed?", "answer": "If the tax invoices for the goods clearly state that interest will be charged on delayed payments, and you have been accepting these invoices without protest, the seller can argue that you implicitly agreed to this condition. However, if there is no written contract and you have consistently disputed this, you have a strong case to argue against the levy of interest.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Invoice Terms", "Implied Agreement", "Contract"]}
{"question": "I can't file a complaint about a defective product because the company that sold it has shut down. What can I do?", "answer": "If a company shuts down, it becomes very difficult to seek a remedy. However, if the business was sold to another company, you might be able to claim against the new owner. If the company was liquidated, you would have to file a claim with the official liquidator, but recovery is often unlikely for a consumer.", "legal_terms": ["Liquidation", "Successor-in-interest", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "What is a 'latent defect' and does the seller have to cover it?", "answer": "A 'latent defect' is a hidden flaw that is not discoverable through a reasonable inspection at the time of purchase or delivery. Sellers are generally liable for latent defects because the buyer could not have known about them. Pre-shipment inspections do not excuse the seller from liability for such hidden defects.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Warranty", "Inspection", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "The seller's ledger shows I owe them money, but my ledger shows a different, lower amount. Which one will the court believe?", "answer": "The court will examine both ledgers and other supporting evidence like invoices, payment receipts, and bank statements. If there are discrepancies, the party that can better substantiate their entries with independent proof will have a stronger case. Neither ledger is automatically accepted as the absolute truth.", "legal_terms": ["Ledger Account", "Evidence", "Reconciliation", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods but threw them away because they were rotting. Can I still claim a refund?", "answer": "It is very difficult to claim a refund if you have destroyed the evidence. The defective goods are the primary proof of your claim. Without them, you cannot prove the defect. It is crucial to preserve the goods, take photos, and if possible, get an expert to examine them before disposal.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Defective Goods", "Burden of Proof", "Spoliation of Evidence"]}
{"question": "I'm a reseller. The manufacturer provided a warranty. Does this warranty extend to my customers?", "answer": "Typically, a manufacturer's warranty is a 'business to business' (B2B) warranty that applies only to you, the direct purchaser. It does not automatically extend to your end customers unless the warranty terms explicitly say so. Your customers would have a claim against you, and you would then have a claim against the manufacturer.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Privity of Contract", "Reseller", "B2B Transaction"]}
{"question": "The contract says the seller can't be held responsible for 'consequential or incidental damages'. What does this mean?", "answer": "This means the seller is limiting their liability to only the direct cost of the defective product (like repair or replacement). They are not responsible for indirect losses you might suffer, such as loss of profit, business disruption, or damage to your reputation, which happened as a 'consequence' of the defect.", "legal_terms": ["Consequential Damages", "Limitation of Liability", "Incidental Damages", "Contract Clause"]}
{"question": "Can I use an email from the seller as evidence in court?", "answer": "Yes, an email can be used as electronic evidence. However, to be properly admitted, it should be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, which certifies the authenticity of the electronic record. Without this certificate, the other party can challenge its admissibility.", "legal_terms": ["Electronic Evidence", "Indian Evidence Act", "Section 65B Certificate", "Admissibility"]}
{"question": "The seller is claiming I owe them money based on old invoices from 5 years ago. Is there a time limit for them to sue me?", "answer": "Yes, there is a time limit. For a suit for recovery of money based on an invoice, the period of limitation is generally three years from the date the payment was due. If they are suing you after three years, the suit may be barred by limitation, unless you have made a part-payment or acknowledged the debt in writing in the last three years.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Period of Limitation", "Recovery of Money"]}
{"question": "I made a part-payment by cheque for a long-pending due. Does this affect the time limit for the seller to sue me?", "answer": "Yes. Making a part-payment towards a debt, especially by cheque, acts as an acknowledgment of the debt and extends the limitation period. A fresh period of three years for the seller to file a suit starts from the date of that payment.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Section 19", "Part-Payment", "Acknowledgment of Debt"]}
{"question": "The seller is suing me for non-payment, but their company isn't even properly represented in court. Can I get the case dismissed?", "answer": "You can raise this as a preliminary objection. A company must be represented by a duly authorized person. However, courts often treat this as a curable defect. The company can rectify the error by submitting a proper board resolution or power of attorney at a later stage, so it may not lead to an immediate dismissal.", "legal_terms": ["Authorization", "Board Resolution", "Power of Attorney", "Curable Defect"]}
{"question": "What is an 'unfair trade practice' regarding defective goods?", "answer": "An 'unfair trade practice' under the Consumer Protection Act includes supplying goods that do not comply with the safety or quality standards prescribed by law or claimed by the seller. Selling defective, old, or refurbished goods as new also qualifies as an unfair trade practice, for which you can seek relief.", "legal_terms": ["Unfair Trade Practice", "Consumer Protection Act", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I bought a product that was defective and it caused further damage to my property. Can I claim for that additional damage?", "answer": "Yes, you can claim for the additional damage as 'consequential damages'. You need to prove that the defect in the product was the direct cause of the subsequent damage to your property. This goes beyond a simple refund for the product itself.", "legal_terms": ["Consequential Damages", "Product Liability", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "The seller promised a high-quality 'prime' product, but it has many defects. What does 'prime' legally mean?", "answer": "The term 'prime' in a contract implies goods of a high standard, suitable for their intended use, and largely free from defects. If the goods supplied have significant defects like rust, wavy edges, or stains, they do not meet the description of 'prime' material, and this constitutes a breach of contract.", "legal_terms": ["Breach of Contract", "Description of Goods", "Prime Quality"]}
{"question": "Can I be forced to accept a credit note for a defective item instead of a cash refund?", "answer": "Whether you have to accept a credit note depends on the seller's return policy and the terms of your purchase agreement. However, under the Consumer Protection Act, a Consumer Commission can order the seller to provide a full refund in cash if the goods are proven to be defective.", "legal_terms": ["Credit Note", "Refund", "Consumer Protection Act", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "A seller sent a legal notice for a bounced cheque, but I never received it. Are they still able to proceed with the case?", "answer": "The seller must prove that the legal notice was sent to your correct address. If they have a valid postal receipt (like registered post), the law presumes the notice was delivered. The burden would then be on you to prove that the address was wrong or you genuinely did not receive it. Simply denying receipt is not enough if they have proof of dispatch.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Service of Notice", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Presumption of Service"]}
{"question": "I'm in a dispute over defective goods. My supplier has filed a winding-up petition against my company. What is this?", "answer": "A winding-up petition is a serious legal action where a creditor asks the court to liquidate (close down) a company to pay off its debts. However, it can only be used for undisputed debts. If you have a genuine and substantial dispute, such as the goods being defective, the court will likely dismiss the winding-up petition and direct the creditor to file a regular civil suit instead.", "legal_terms": ["Winding-up Petition", "Companies Act", "Disputed Debt", "Bona Fide Dispute"]}
{"question": "Do I have to mitigate my losses if a supplier gives me defective goods?", "answer": "Yes. The law requires you to take reasonable steps to mitigate (or reduce) your losses. For example, you should try to sell the defective goods at a salvage price if possible. You cannot simply let the losses accumulate and then claim the entire amount from the supplier. Your final claim will be for the loss that remained after your reasonable mitigation efforts.", "legal_terms": ["Mitigation of Loss", "Indian Contract Act", "Damages", "Duty to Mitigate"]}
{"question": "The seller's representative came to my office for a 'reconciliation meeting' about my dues. What is the legal effect of this meeting?", "answer": "A reconciliation meeting is an attempt to settle accounts. Any minutes or statements signed during this meeting can be used as evidence of an agreed-upon outstanding amount. If a net amount payable is determined after accounting for defective goods, it can be considered a binding agreement on the reconciled figure.", "legal_terms": ["Reconciliation of Accounts", "Settlement", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a 'credit note' and a 'debit note' in a defective goods dispute?", "answer": "A 'credit note' is issued by the seller to the buyer, reducing the amount the buyer owes (e.g., as a refund for returned defective goods). A 'debit note' is issued by the buyer to the seller, formally claiming a certain amount from the seller (e.g., for the value of defective goods the buyer is returning or rejecting).", "legal_terms": ["Credit Note", "Debit Note", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "If I am a proprietor of a firm, can the legal case for a bounced cheque be filed against me personally?", "answer": "Yes. In a proprietorship, the firm and the proprietor are legally the same entity. A case for a bounced cheque issued from the firm's account will be filed against both the firm (represented by the proprietor) and you as the proprietor who is personally liable for the firm's debts.", "legal_terms": ["Proprietorship", "Liability", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "The seller supplied goods without any invoice. Now they are claiming a huge amount. Do I have to pay?", "answer": "A seller must provide an invoice or bill as proof of sale and the amount due. Without an invoice or a statement of account, it is very difficult for them to prove the transaction and the liability. The burden is on them to prove the debt, and a lack of invoices severely weakens their case.", "legal_terms": ["Invoice", "Burden of Proof", "Recovery of Money"]}
{"question": "A seller is claiming interest on a payment that's been due for a long time. Is this valid if it's a commercial transaction?", "answer": "In commercial transactions, even if there is no express contract for interest, courts may award 'pendente lite' (during the suit) and future interest at a reasonable rate (e.g., 12% per annum). This is because in business, delayed payment means a loss of capital for the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Commercial Transaction", "Pendente Lite Interest"]}
{"question": "My supplier is based in Bangalore, but they delivered defective goods to me in Kerala. Can I file a suit in Kerala?", "answer": "Yes, you can likely file a suit in Kerala. The 'cause of action' arises where the offer was made, where the acceptance was communicated, where the goods were delivered, or where payment was made. Since the goods were delivered to you in Kerala, a part of the cause of action arose there, giving Kerala courts jurisdiction.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Place of Delivery"]}
{"question": "The seller admits in court that they sometimes issue credit notes for defective goods. How does this admission help my case?", "answer": "This admission strengthens your argument that it was a standard business practice between you to get credit for defective goods. It supports your claim that your current request for a refund or credit for defective items is reasonable and consistent with your past dealings.", "legal_terms": ["Admission", "Course of Dealing", "Evidence", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "Is a contract for 'sale or return' of goods a final sale?", "answer": "No, it is a conditional sale. In a 'sale or return' contract, the ownership of the goods does not pass to you (the buyer) until you signify your approval or acceptance to the seller, or do an act adopting the transaction (like reselling them). Until then, you can return the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Sale or Return", "Conditional Sale"]}
{"question": "A seller is trying to use a previous statement I made in another case against me. Is this allowed?", "answer": "Yes, a statement or admission made by you in a previous legal proceeding (like a petition or affidavit) can be used as evidence against you in a current case. It is considered an admission, and you would be 'estopped' from denying it unless you can provide a very strong explanation.", "legal_terms": ["Admission", "Estoppel", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I was forced to pay compensation to my customers because of defective parts from my supplier. Can I recover this from the supplier?", "answer": "Yes, you can file a claim against your supplier for the damages you had to pay to your customers. You must prove that the supplier's defective parts were the direct cause of the problem, and that the compensation you paid was a reasonable and foreseeable consequence of that defect.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Indemnity", "Causation", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "What is a 'running account' in a business transaction?", "answer": "A 'running account' is a continuous account between a buyer and seller with a series of transactions (debits and credits). Payments are not typically tied to specific invoices but are made against the overall balance. For limitation purposes, the time limit to sue for the balance due often starts from the date of the last transaction or payment.", "legal_terms": ["Running Account", "Open Account", "Limitation Act"]}
{"question": "The seller did not supply C-Forms for an inter-state purchase. Can they charge me the full tax rate?", "answer": "Yes. In inter-state sales, a concessional tax rate is applicable only if the buyer furnishes the required C-Form to the seller. If you fail to provide the C-Form, the seller is liable to pay the full, non-concessional rate of tax and can legally recover that difference from you.", "legal_terms": ["C-Form", "Central Sales Tax Act", "Inter-state Sale"]}
{"question": "A company I bought goods from is a private limited company. Who is legally responsible if the goods are defective?", "answer": "The legal entity responsible is the private limited company itself, not its directors or shareholders personally. You would file a complaint or suit against 'M/s. [Company Name] Pvt. Ltd.' The company is a separate legal person and is liable for its own debts and obligations.", "legal_terms": ["Private Limited Company", "Separate Legal Entity", "Liability"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by a company, but the person who signed the complaint is just a GPA holder, not a director. Is the case valid?", "answer": "Yes, the case is likely valid. A company can authorize a GPA (General Power of Attorney) holder to represent it and file legal complaints on its behalf. As long as there is a valid GPA or a board resolution authorizing that person, the complaint is maintainable.", "legal_terms": ["General Power of Attorney (GPA)", "Authorization", "Maintainability"]}
{"question": "Can a seller who supplied defective goods win a cheque bounce case against me?", "answer": "It is possible. When you issue a cheque, the law presumes it's for a valid debt. To win, you must rebut this presumption by proving, with strong evidence, that the goods were defective and that you therefore owed nothing or a lesser amount. If you fail to prove the defect, the seller can win the cheque bounce case.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Presumption of Liability", "Rebuttal", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I sent a reply to a legal notice denying liability for a bounced cheque. Will this help my case?", "answer": "Yes, sending a timely reply to a legal notice is very important. It allows you to state your defense (e.g., defective goods) at the earliest opportunity. If you don't reply, the court might assume that you had no defense at that time and that your later claims are an afterthought.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Reply", "Defense", "Afterthought"]}
{"question": "The seller is suing me over four invoices, but I only made a part payment. Does that mean I've accepted all four invoices?", "answer": "Not necessarily. A part payment, unless specified otherwise, is usually applied to the oldest outstanding debt. It does not automatically mean you have admitted liability for all four invoices, especially if some of them are in dispute due to defective goods.", "legal_terms": ["Part-Payment", "Appropriation of Payments", "Invoice", "Liability"]}
{"question": "The seller I'm in a dispute with had promised to replace defective goods but hasn't. What can I do?", "answer": "A promise to replace defective goods is an admission of the defect. If the seller fails to honor this promise, you can use their communication (emails, letters) as evidence in a consumer complaint or civil suit to enforce the replacement or claim a refund for the value of the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Breach of Promise", "Evidence", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "I bought an electronic item that was 'dead on arrival'. The seller says I have to go to the service center. Is this correct?", "answer": "While the warranty might direct you to a service center for repairs, a product that is defective from the very beginning ('dead on arrival') is a clear case of being supplied a non-functional product. You have a strong case to demand an immediate replacement or full refund directly from the seller, as they failed to provide a merchantable good.", "legal_terms": ["Dead on Arrival (DOA)", "Merchantable Quality", "Defective Goods", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "A seller charged me on an invoice for goods I never received. How can I prove I didn't get them?", "answer": "The burden of proof is on the seller to prove delivery. You can ask them to produce a signed delivery receipt, proof of dispatch from a courier, or transporter's records. Your own inventory records and GST returns (like GSTR-2B which shows inward supplies) can also serve as evidence that you never received the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Proof of Delivery", "Burden of Proof", "Invoice", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "The seller is using a computer-generated ledger as proof against me. Can I challenge it?", "answer": "Yes, you can challenge it. For a computer-generated document to be admissible as evidence, it must be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act. You can also challenge its accuracy by pointing out discrepancies, showing it was created much later, or by presenting your own, more reliable, set of accounts.", "legal_terms": ["Electronic Evidence", "Section 65B Certificate", "Ledger Account", "Admissibility"]}
{"question": "The seller agreed to settle our dispute for a lower amount, but then backed out. Can I enforce the settlement?", "answer": "If the settlement was just a verbal discussion, it is very hard to enforce. However, if you have a written agreement, signed minutes of a meeting, or a clear email exchange confirming the settlement terms, you can present this to the court as a concluded agreement that should be honored.", "legal_terms": ["Settlement Agreement", "Enforceability", "Concluded Contract", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "My business reputation has suffered because of a supplier's faulty products. Can I claim compensation for this loss of goodwill?", "answer": "Claiming for loss of reputation or goodwill is considered a claim for 'indirect' or 'consequential' damages. It is often difficult to prove and quantify. Unless your contract with the supplier specifically allows for such claims, courts are generally hesitant to award compensation for reputational damage in a standard commercial dispute.", "legal_terms": ["Goodwill", "Consequential Damages", "Reputation", "Damages"]}
{"question": "In a legal dispute, who has the 'burden of proof' when it comes to defective goods?", "answer": "Initially, the burden of proof is on you, the buyer, to establish a prima facie case that the goods are defective. You must provide some evidence. Once you do that, the burden can shift to the seller to prove that the goods were not defective or that the defect was your fault.", "legal_terms": ["Burden of Proof", "Evidence Act", "Defective Goods", "Prima Facie"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a warranty and a guarantee?", "answer": "Legally, a 'warranty' is a promise that the goods are of a certain quality, and a breach of warranty usually entitles you to damages (like repair or compensation). A 'guarantee' is a stronger promise, and a breach can sometimes allow you to reject the goods entirely and get a full replacement or refund. However, the terms are often used interchangeably, and the specific wording in your contract is what matters most.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Guarantee", "Breach of Contract", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "Can I return goods if they don't match the description, even if they are not technically broken?", "answer": "Yes. Under the Sale of Goods Act, there is an implied condition that the goods must correspond with the description under which they were sold. If you ordered a specific model or type and received something different, you have the right to reject the goods, as this is a breach of a fundamental condition of the contract.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Sale by Description", "Breach of Condition", "Right to Reject"]}
{"question": "I'm a small business owner. Can I file a complaint in a Consumer Court?", "answer": "Yes, you can. A small business owner who buys goods can be considered a 'consumer' as long as the goods are not for a 'commercial purpose' of large-scale resale. If you buy goods for self-employment or to use in your own business (like a printer for your office), you are eligible to file a complaint in the Consumer Court.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer", "Commercial Purpose", "Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "The seller is trying to avoid liability by saying their contract has an 'entire agreement clause'. What does this mean?", "answer": "An 'entire agreement clause' means that only the terms written within the formal contract are legally binding. It prevents either party from making claims based on verbal promises, emails, or discussions that happened during negotiations but were not included in the final signed contract. It aims to ensure that the written contract is the complete and final agreement.", "legal_terms": ["Entire Agreement Clause", "Contract Interpretation", "Parol Evidence Rule"]}
{"question": "Is an oral agreement to supply goods legally valid?", "answer": "Yes, an oral agreement is legally valid and enforceable under the Indian Contract Act. However, it is extremely difficult to prove in court. Without any written evidence like emails, purchase orders, or invoices, the existence and terms of the agreement become a matter of 'he said, she said', which makes legal action very challenging.", "legal_terms": ["Oral Agreement", "Indian Contract Act", "Evidence", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller took a cheque from me but is delaying its presentation in the bank. Is there a time limit?", "answer": "Yes, a cheque is valid for three months from the date written on it. The seller (payee) must present it to the bank within this period. If they fail to do so, the cheque becomes 'stale' and the bank will not honor it.", "legal_terms": ["Cheque Validity", "Stale Cheque", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "Can a seller sue me for payment if they supplied goods that were not fit for the specific purpose I told them I needed them for?", "answer": "No, they would have a very weak case. If you expressly told the seller the specific purpose for which you needed the goods, relying on their skill and judgment, there is an implied condition under the Sale of Goods Act that the goods will be fit for that purpose. If they are not, you are not liable to pay and can even counter-sue for damages.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Implied Condition", "Fitness for Purpose", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "I found out a seller sent me defective goods. How quickly do I need to complain?", "answer": "You should complain as soon as you discover the defect. The law requires you to act within a 'reasonable time'. Unreasonable delay can be used against you, with the seller arguing that you accepted the goods by not complaining earlier. Prompt written communication is key.", "legal_terms": ["Reasonable Time", "Notification of Defect", "Laches"]}
{"question": "The seller is a partnership firm. Who should I name in my legal complaint?", "answer": "You should name the partnership firm itself (e.g., 'M/s. ABC Enterprises') and you can also name its partners. This is because, in a partnership, the partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the firm.", "legal_terms": ["Partnership Firm", "Joint and Several Liability", "Parties to a Suit"]}
{"question": "I am being sued for an amount that includes tax, but the seller never provided the required tax forms. Is this correct?", "answer": "If the transaction required you to provide a tax form (like a C-Form) to get a lower tax rate, and you failed to do so, the seller is legally entitled to claim the higher tax amount from you. The liability to pay the full tax falls on the seller if the form is not furnished, and they can pass that cost on to you.", "legal_terms": ["Tax Liability", "C-Form", "Central Sales Tax Act"]}
{"question": "What does it mean when a court says a finding is 'perverse'?", "answer": "A finding is considered 'perverse' if it is so irrational or unsupported by the evidence on record that no reasonable person could have reached that conclusion. It's a high standard, but if an arbitrator's or lower court's finding is deemed perverse, an appellate court can set it aside.", "legal_terms": ["Perverse Finding", "Appellate Review", "Arbitration"]}
{"question": "I returned defective goods but the seller is still suing me for the full price. What is my best defense?", "answer": "Your best defense is to provide concrete proof of the return. This could be a signed receipt from the seller acknowledging the return, a credit note issued by them, or tracking information from a courier. Without proof that the goods were actually returned and received by the seller, it is very difficult to defend against their claim for payment.", "legal_terms": ["Proof of Return", "Defective Goods", "Evidence", "Defense"]}
{"question": "Can a company avoid a cheque bounce case by claiming the director who signed the cheque has left the company?", "answer": "No. The liability for a cheque bounce lies with the company and the persons who were in charge of its affairs at the time the cheque was issued and the offence was committed. A director cannot escape liability simply by resigning after the cheque has bounced.", "legal_terms": ["Vicarious Liability", "Section 141 NI Act", "Director's Liability"]}
{"question": "The seller's invoice has very fine print on the back with many conditions. Are these legally binding?", "answer": "Yes, terms and conditions printed on an invoice can be legally binding, especially in commercial transactions where there is a history of dealings. By accepting the invoice and the goods without objecting to those terms, you are often considered to have implicitly agreed to them.", "legal_terms": ["Fine Print", "Invoice Terms", "Implied Consent", "Contract"]}{"question": "What can a buyer do if the seller ignores a complaint?", "answer": "They can file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "What should I do if a company sells me a defective product?", "answer": "Case Summary:\n\nYou have purchased a product that turned out to be defective, and you are seeking guidance on how to resolve the issue.\n\nCase Type:\n\nConsumer Law, Defective Goods\n\nLegal Provisions:\n\nThe Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides a strong framework to protect your rights. Key provisions include:\n\n- **Section 2(10) - \"Defect\":** This defines a defect as any fault, imperfection, or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, potency, purity, or standard of a product.\n- **Section 2(47) - \"Unfair Trade Practice\":** Supplying defective goods is considered an unfair trade practice, and you have the right to seek redressal against it.\n- **Section 2(9) - Consumer Rights:** This includes the right to be protected against the marketing of goods which are hazardous to life and property and the right to be informed about the quality and purity of the goods.\n\nLegal Remedies:\n\nTo address the issue of receiving a defective product, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Contact the Seller/Manufacturer:** Your first step should be to contact the seller or the manufacturer. Explain the defect clearly, provide proof of purchase (invoice/bill), and request a replacement, repair, or a full refund as per the warranty terms.\n\n2.  **Send a Written Complaint/Email:** If verbal communication doesn't work, send a formal written complaint via email or registered post. Clearly state the problem, the resolution you expect, and a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 15 days) for them to respond.\n\n3.  **Send a Legal Notice:** If you do not receive a satisfactory response, you can have a lawyer send a formal legal notice. This often prompts companies to resolve the issue to avoid litigation.\n\n4.  **File a Complaint in Consumer Court:** If the seller still fails to provide a remedy, you can file a complaint with the appropriate Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. You can do this yourself or through a lawyer. Complaints can now be filed electronically through the E-Daakhil portal.\n\nPractical Advice:\n\n- **Preserve Evidence:** Keep the defective product in its original condition as much as possible. Take clear photos and videos of the defect. Keep all receipts, invoices, warranty cards, and communication records with the seller.\n- **Document Everything:** Maintain a log of all your interactions, including dates, times, names of people you spoke to, and what was discussed.\n- **Check Warranty Terms:** Review the warranty card to understand your rights regarding repair, replacement, or refund.\n\nActing promptly and documenting every step is crucial for building a strong case. The law ensures that you are not left with a faulty product and are entitled to a fair resolution.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Consumer Protection Act, 2019", "Unfair Trade Practice", "Warranty", "Legal Notice", "Consumer Court"]}
{"question": "I bought a product from a company in another state online. Where can I file a consumer complaint if it's defective?", "answer": "You can file a complaint in the Consumer Commission located where you live or work. Under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, jurisdiction is consumer-friendly. The place where the seller is located does not prevent you from filing a case in your own city, as part of the transaction (like payment or delivery) happened there.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Consumer Protection Act, 2019", "Cause of Action"]}
{"question": "I paid for goods with a cheque, but they were defective. Can I just tell my bank to stop the payment?", "answer": "Yes, you can instruct your bank to stop payment on a cheque if the goods are defective. However, the seller can still file a case against you under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. You will then have to prove in court that the goods were genuinely defective and that you had a valid reason to stop the payment. You must have strong evidence of the defects.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Section 138", "Defective Goods", "Stop Payment"]}
{"question": "The seller is refusing to accept my return, saying I should have checked the item at delivery. What are my rights?", "answer": "Under the Sale of Goods Act, a buyer has the right to a reasonable opportunity to examine goods to see if they conform to the contract. While it is good practice to inspect items on delivery, you are not always required to do so on the spot, especially for latent defects that are not immediately obvious. If a defect is discovered later, you can still claim your rights under the warranty or the Consumer Protection Act.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Right to Examine", "Latent Defect", "Warranty"]}
{"question": "What kind of proof do I need to show that a product I received is defective?", "answer": "To prove a product is defective, you need solid evidence. This can include photos and videos of the defect, communication with the seller (emails, letters), reports from an expert or certified technician, and any complaints from other customers if available. Merely stating the product is defective without evidence is often not enough to win a case.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Evidence", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller has taken back defective goods from me before but is now refusing. Does this help my case?", "answer": "Yes, if a seller has a history or habit of accepting returns and issuing credit notes for defective goods, it can support your claim that the current refusal is unfair. This past conduct can be presented as evidence to show an established practice between you and the seller, making your claim for the current defective product stronger.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Course of Dealing", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "The seller's invoice mentions a warranty, but we never signed a separate warranty agreement. Is the invoice warranty valid?", "answer": "Yes, if the warranty terms are printed on the invoice and you have accepted the goods and the invoice without objection, those terms are generally considered part of the sales contract. By accepting the transaction, you implicitly agree to its stated terms, including the warranty conditions.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Invoice", "Terms and Conditions", "Contract"]}
{"question": "Only a few items in my bulk order were defective. Do I still have to pay the seller?", "answer": "You are generally liable to pay for the non-defective goods you received and accepted. For the defective items, you can seek a replacement, repair, or a refund/credit note from the seller. It is crucial to prove which specific goods were defective and their value to justify withholding that portion of the payment.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Partial Defect", "Liability", "Credit Note"]}
{"question": "My cheque to a seller bounced. Can I argue in court that the goods were defective and I didn't owe the money?", "answer": "Yes, claiming that the goods were defective is a valid defense in a cheque bounce case under the Negotiable Instruments Act. However, the burden of proof will be on you to convince the court that the goods were indeed faulty and that this discharged you from the liability to pay. You must provide strong evidence of the defects.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Section 138", "Defective Goods", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller sued me for non-payment, but their goods were faulty and caused me losses. Can I sue them back in the same case?", "answer": "Yes, if a seller sues you for payment, you can file a 'counter-claim' in the same lawsuit for the damages you suffered due to their defective goods. This allows the court to hear both claims together and decide the final amount owed by either party after setting off the claims against each other.", "legal_terms": ["Counter-claim", "Set-off", "Defective Goods", "Damages"]}
{"question": "I've been telling the seller about the defective product on the phone, but they ignore me. Is that enough?", "answer": "While phone calls are a start, they are difficult to prove. It is highly recommended to communicate your complaint in writing, such as through email or a registered letter. A written record is crucial evidence to show that you formally notified the seller about the defect and gave them an opportunity to resolve it. Courts give more weight to written communication.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Written Communication", "Defective Goods", "Complaint"]}
{"question": "The seller claims I accepted the goods because their representative inspected them before shipping. But the goods are defective. What can I do?", "answer": "Even if a pre-shipment inspection was done, you may still have rights, especially if the defects were 'latent' (not discoverable by a normal inspection). If the inspection was limited in scope and couldn't have revealed the internal flaws, you can argue that you did not lose your right to reject the goods or claim damages upon discovering the defects after delivery.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Inspection", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "I gave a seller a signed blank cheque as security for future purchases. Now they have filled an amount and presented it, even though I have issues with the goods. Is this legal?", "answer": "While providing a blank cheque is risky, the law presumes it was issued for a legally enforceable debt. If the seller presents it, the burden is on you to prove it was only for security and that no such debt exists due to defective goods or other issues. If you cannot prove this, you could be held liable under the Negotiable Instruments Act.", "legal_terms": ["Blank Cheque", "Security", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Legally Enforceable Debt", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "What happens if a seller of defective goods doesn't have a registered office in my city?", "answer": "You can still file a suit against the seller in your city if a part of the cause of action, such as placing the order, receiving the goods, or making payment, occurred there. The seller's location is not the only factor for determining jurisdiction.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Civil Procedure Code"]}
{"question": "A product I bought has rusted, but it's meant to be used with water. Is this a defect?", "answer": "Yes, if a product like a sprinkler, which is intended for use with water, rusts quickly, it is considered defective. The product is not of merchantable quality as it fails to meet the basic standard expected for its intended use.", "legal_terms": ["Defect", "Merchantable Quality", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "I bought something from a company that was later sold to another company. Who is responsible for the warranty?", "answer": "When a business is sold, its assets and liabilities, including receivables and warranty obligations, are often transferred to the new owner. The new company (the successor-in-interest) would typically be responsible for honoring the warranty for products sold by the original company.", "legal_terms": ["Successor-in-interest", "Business Transfer Agreement", "Warranty", "Liability"]}
{"question": "How long is a warranty valid if the purchase order just says '14 months' without a start date?", "answer": "Generally, if a warranty period is mentioned, it is interpreted to run from the date of sale from the seller to you (the immediate buyer). It does not usually start from the date you resell it to an end consumer, as the seller has no control or knowledge of that subsequent sale.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty Period", "Date of Sale", "Contract Interpretation"]}
{"question": "Can I claim storage costs for keeping defective goods that the seller won't take back?", "answer": "Claiming storage costs for defective goods is difficult. Such claims are often considered claims for damages rather than warranty claims. To succeed, you must prove there was a breach of contract, a direct loss because of it, and a causal link. Courts may not entertain such claims if not explicitly covered in your agreement.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Breach of Contract", "Warranty Claim"]}
{"question": "The seller sent me an email admitting I owe a certain amount after deducting for some returned goods. Can I use this as proof?", "answer": "Yes, a written communication like an email from the seller confirming a balance due after adjustments for defective returns can be used as a strong piece of evidence. It serves as an admission of liability for the returned goods and helps establish the outstanding amount.", "legal_terms": ["Admission of Liability", "Evidence", "Reconciliation of Accounts"]}
{"question": "A seller is suing me for non-payment, but they haven't provided a statement of account. How does this affect their case?", "answer": "In a suit for recovery of money, the absence of a statement of account or other sufficient documentary evidence makes it very difficult for the seller to prove their claim. Without clear computation and proof, a court may not grant the full amount claimed by the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Statement of Account", "Burden of Proof", "Documentary Evidence"]}
{"question": "My customer is holding back payment because the goods I sold them were defective. Can I claim this loss from my supplier?", "answer": "Yes, you can claim this as a loss. However, you must prove that the goods from your supplier were indeed defective, that you supplied these specific goods to your customer, and that the customer's non-payment is a direct result of the defects. You need to provide invoices and communication to link the entire chain of events.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Defective Goods", "Causation", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "I am being sued, and the other party is using my company's old balance sheet against me. Is that allowed?", "answer": "Yes, balance sheets and other financial documents can be used as evidence in court. If a balance sheet shows an amount due to a creditor (the other party), it can be seen as an admission of debt. You would need to provide strong reasons to dispute that entry.", "legal_terms": ["Balance Sheet", "Evidence", "Admission of Debt", "Sundry Creditors"]}
{"question": "I issued a debit note to my supplier for defective goods, but they claim they never received it. What should I do?", "answer": "Simply issuing a debit note is not enough; you must prove that the supplier received it. Without proof of receipt (like a signed delivery confirmation or an email read-receipt), the supplier can deny it, and the court may not consider the debit note as a valid adjustment against your dues.", "legal_terms": ["Debit Note", "Proof of Receipt", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods in an international 'FOB' contract. Can I still reject them after they arrive in my country?", "answer": "Yes. In an FOB (Free on Board) contract, while the risk passes to you once the goods are on the ship, you retain the right to inspect and reject them upon arrival if they are defective. The FOB term primarily deals with risk during transit, not the fundamental quality of the goods.", "legal_terms": ["FOB Contract", "Sale of Goods Act", "Right to Reject", "Inspection"]}
{"question": "How are damages calculated if I receive defective goods under an FOB contract?", "answer": "Generally, damages are the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods at the port of shipment on the date of breach. However, if the seller knew the goods were for a specific resale market (like the US), the court may consider the market price at that destination for calculating damages.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "FOB Contract", "Market Price", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "The supplier's inspector (SGS) checked the goods before they were shipped, but they still turned out to be defective. Can the supplier deny responsibility?", "answer": "No. A pre-shipment inspection certificate is not always conclusive proof of quality. If the inspection was limited or could not have revealed latent (hidden) defects, the supplier remains liable for breach of warranty. The inspector's certificate does not relieve the seller of their contractual obligation to supply goods of the agreed quality.", "legal_terms": ["Pre-shipment Inspection", "Latent Defect", "Warranty", "SGS Certificate"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods and had to sell them at a lower 'salvage' price. Can I claim the difference from the supplier?", "answer": "Yes. The measure of damages for defective goods is typically the difference between what the goods would have been worth if they were not defective (market value) and the price you actually got for them (salvage value). You can sue the supplier to recover this loss.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Salvage Value", "Market Value", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My supplier failed to deliver a second lot of goods after I complained about the first lot being defective. Can I claim damages for the non-delivery?", "answer": "Yes, if you have a concluded contract for the second lot. The supplier cannot refuse to supply the second lot just because you raised a genuine complaint about the first. Their failure to deliver the second lot would be a separate breach of contract for which you can claim damages.", "legal_terms": ["Breach of Contract", "Non-delivery", "Damages", "Concluded Contract"]}
{"question": "I tried to settle my cheque bounce case by offering to pay, but the other party refused. What happens now?", "answer": "A cheque bounce case under Section 138 of the NI Act can only be compounded (settled) with the consent of both parties. If the complainant does not agree to your settlement offer, the court cannot force them to accept it. The trial will proceed, and the court will decide the case on its merits.", "legal_terms": ["Compounding of Offence", "Section 138", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Settlement"]}
{"question": "The court convicted me in a cheque bounce case. Can the punishment be just a fine instead of jail time?", "answer": "Yes. For an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act, the court can sentence you to a fine, imprisonment, or both. Courts often prioritize compensating the complainant and may impose a fine (up to twice the cheque amount) as the primary punishment, with imprisonment only if the fine is not paid.", "legal_terms": ["Sentence", "Section 138", "Fine", "Compensation"]}
{"question": "A business partner gave me an undated security cheque. He says the goods were defective. Can I fill in the date and deposit it?", "answer": "Yes, you can fill in the date on an undated cheque. The law presumes it was given for a valid debt. If the cheque is dishonored, the issuer has to prove in court that there was no existing liability at that time because the goods were defective. The burden of proof is on him.", "legal_terms": ["Undated Cheque", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Burden of Proof", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My employee made a note on an invoice that goods were defective. Can this be used as evidence against my company?", "answer": "Yes, a note made by your employee (like a salesman) on an official document like an invoice can be used as evidence. It suggests that your company was aware of the defects at that time. It's an important piece of evidence for the buyer.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Invoice", "Admission", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I didn't file a written complaint about defective goods, but I told the delivery person. Is that sufficient?", "answer": "Telling the delivery person is not sufficient. You must formally communicate the defect to the seller or an authorized representative of the company. A court is unlikely to accept a conversation with a driver or a junior employee as a valid notification of defect. Always communicate in writing.", "legal_terms": ["Notification of Defect", "Complaint", "Evidence", "Written Communication"]}
{"question": "The cheque I gave for a purchase bounced. I had already paid a part of the amount in cash before the cheque was presented. Is the case valid?", "answer": "The case may not be valid. If you make a part-payment after issuing a cheque but before it's presented, the legally enforceable debt is reduced. The payee should endorse the part-payment on the cheque and present it for the balance amount only. Presenting it for the full original amount when a lesser amount is due is not permissible under law.", "legal_terms": ["Part-Payment", "Section 56 NI Act", "Legally Enforceable Debt", "Endorsement"]}
{"question": "The seller is charging interest on delayed payments, but we never signed an agreement for it. Is this allowed?", "answer": "If the tax invoices for the goods clearly state that interest will be charged on delayed payments, and you have been accepting these invoices without protest, the seller can argue that you implicitly agreed to this condition. However, if there is no written contract and you have consistently disputed this, you have a strong case to argue against the levy of interest.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Invoice Terms", "Implied Agreement", "Contract"]}
{"question": "I can't file a complaint about a defective product because the company that sold it has shut down. What can I do?", "answer": "If a company shuts down, it becomes very difficult to seek a remedy. However, if the business was sold to another company, you might be able to claim against the new owner. If the company was liquidated, you would have to file a claim with the official liquidator, but recovery is often unlikely for a consumer.", "legal_terms": ["Liquidation", "Successor-in-interest", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "What is a 'latent defect' and does the seller have to cover it?", "answer": "A 'latent defect' is a hidden flaw that is not discoverable through a reasonable inspection at the time of purchase or delivery. Sellers are generally liable for latent defects because the buyer could not have known about them. Pre-shipment inspections do not excuse the seller from liability for such hidden defects.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Warranty", "Inspection", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "The seller's ledger shows I owe them money, but my ledger shows a different, lower amount. Which one will the court believe?", "answer": "The court will examine both ledgers and other supporting evidence like invoices, payment receipts, and bank statements. If there are discrepancies, the party that can better substantiate their entries with independent proof will have a stronger case. Neither ledger is automatically accepted as the absolute truth.", "legal_terms": ["Ledger Account", "Evidence", "Reconciliation", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods but threw them away because they were rotting. Can I still claim a refund?", "answer": "It is very difficult to claim a refund if you have destroyed the evidence. The defective goods are the primary proof of your claim. Without them, you cannot prove the defect. It is crucial to preserve the goods, take photos, and if possible, get an expert to examine them before disposal.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Defective Goods", "Burden of Proof", "Spoliation of Evidence"]}
{"question": "I'm a reseller. The manufacturer provided a warranty. Does this warranty extend to my customers?", "answer": "Typically, a manufacturer's warranty is a 'business to business' (B2B) warranty that applies only to you, the direct purchaser. It does not automatically extend to your end customers unless the warranty terms explicitly say so. Your customers would have a claim against you, and you would then have a claim against the manufacturer.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Privity of Contract", "Reseller", "B2B Transaction"]}
{"question": "The contract says the seller can't be held responsible for 'consequential or incidental damages'. What does this mean?", "answer": "This means the seller is limiting their liability to only the direct cost of the defective product (like repair or replacement). They are not responsible for indirect losses you might suffer, such as loss of profit, business disruption, or damage to your reputation, which happened as a 'consequence' of the defect.", "legal_terms": ["Consequential Damages", "Limitation of Liability", "Incidental Damages", "Contract Clause"]}
{"question": "Can I use an email from the seller as evidence in court?", "answer": "Yes, an email can be used as electronic evidence. However, to be properly admitted, it should be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, which certifies the authenticity of the electronic record. Without this certificate, the other party can challenge its admissibility.", "legal_terms": ["Electronic Evidence", "Indian Evidence Act", "Section 65B Certificate", "Admissibility"]}
{"question": "The seller is claiming I owe them money based on old invoices from 5 years ago. Is there a time limit for them to sue me?", "answer": "Yes, there is a time limit. For a suit for recovery of money based on an invoice, the period of limitation is generally three years from the date the payment was due. If they are suing you after three years, the suit may be barred by limitation, unless you have made a part-payment or acknowledged the debt in writing in the last three years.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Period of Limitation", "Recovery of Money"]}
{"question": "I made a part-payment by cheque for a long-pending due. Does this affect the time limit for the seller to sue me?", "answer": "Yes. Making a part-payment towards a debt, especially by cheque, acts as an acknowledgment of the debt and extends the limitation period. A fresh period of three years for the seller to file a suit starts from the date of that payment.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Section 19", "Part-Payment", "Acknowledgment of Debt"]}
{"question": "The seller is suing me, but their company isn't even properly represented in court. Can I get the case dismissed?", "answer": "You can raise this as a preliminary objection. A company must be represented by a duly authorized person. However, courts often treat this as a curable defect. The company can rectify the error by submitting a proper board resolution or power of attorney at a later stage, so it may not lead to an immediate dismissal.", "legal_terms": ["Authorization", "Board Resolution", "Power of Attorney", "Curable Defect"]}
{"question": "What is an 'unfair trade practice' regarding defective goods?", "answer": "An 'unfair trade practice' under the Consumer Protection Act includes supplying goods that do not comply with the safety or quality standards prescribed by the law or claimed by the seller. Selling defective, old, or refurbished goods as new also qualifies as an unfair trade practice, for which you can seek relief.", "legal_terms": ["Unfair Trade Practice", "Consumer Protection Act", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I bought a product that was defective and it caused further damage to my property. Can I claim for that additional damage?", "answer": "Yes, you can claim for the additional damage as 'consequential damages'. You need to prove that the defect in the product was the direct cause of the subsequent damage to your property. This goes beyond a simple refund for the product itself.", "legal_terms": ["Consequential Damages", "Product Liability", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "The seller promised a high-quality 'prime' product, but it has many defects. What does 'prime' legally mean?", "answer": "The term 'prime' in a contract implies goods of a high standard, suitable for their intended use, and largely free from defects. If the goods supplied have significant defects like rust, wavy edges, or stains, they do not meet the description of 'prime' material, and this constitutes a breach of contract.", "legal_terms": ["Breach of Contract", "Description of Goods", "Prime Quality"]}
{"question": "Can I be forced to accept a credit note for a defective item instead of a cash refund?", "answer": "Whether you have to accept a credit note depends on the seller's return policy and the terms of your purchase agreement. However, under the Consumer Protection Act, a Consumer Commission can order the seller to provide a full refund in cash if the goods are proven to be defective.", "legal_terms": ["Credit Note", "Refund", "Consumer Protection Act", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "A seller sent a legal notice for a bounced cheque, but I never received it. Are they still able to proceed with the case?", "answer": "The seller must prove that the legal notice was sent to your correct address. If they have a valid postal receipt (like registered post), the law presumes the notice was delivered. The burden would then be on you to prove that the address was wrong or you genuinely did not receive it. Simply denying receipt is not enough if they have proof of dispatch.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Service of Notice", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Presumption of Service"]}
{"question": "I'm in a dispute over defective goods. My supplier has filed a winding-up petition against my company. What is this?", "answer": "A winding-up petition is a serious legal action where a creditor asks the court to liquidate (close down) a company to pay off its debts. However, it can only be used for undisputed debts. If you have a genuine and substantial dispute, such as the goods being defective, the court will likely dismiss the winding-up petition and direct the creditor to file a regular civil suit instead.", "legal_terms": ["Winding-up Petition", "Companies Act", "Disputed Debt", "Bona Fide Dispute"]}
{"question": "Do I have to mitigate my losses if a supplier gives me defective goods?", "answer": "Yes. The law requires you to take reasonable steps to mitigate (or reduce) your losses. For example, you should try to sell the defective goods at a salvage price if possible. You cannot simply let the losses accumulate and then claim the entire amount from the supplier. Your final claim will be for the loss that remained after your reasonable mitigation efforts.", "legal_terms": ["Mitigation of Loss", "Indian Contract Act", "Damages", "Duty to Mitigate"]}
{"question": "The seller's representative came to my office for a 'reconciliation meeting' about my dues. What is the legal effect of this meeting?", "answer": "A reconciliation meeting is an attempt to settle accounts. Any minutes or statements signed during this meeting can be used as evidence of an agreed-upon outstanding amount. If a net amount payable is determined after accounting for defective goods, it can be considered a binding agreement on the reconciled figure.", "legal_terms": ["Reconciliation of Accounts", "Settlement", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a 'credit note' and a 'debit note' in a defective goods dispute?", "answer": "A 'credit note' is issued by the seller to the buyer, reducing the amount the buyer owes (e.g., as a refund for returned defective goods). A 'debit note' is issued by the buyer to the seller, formally claiming a certain amount from the seller (e.g., for the value of defective goods the buyer is returning or rejecting).", "legal_terms": ["Credit Note", "Debit Note", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "If I am a proprietor of a firm, can the legal case for a bounced cheque be filed against me personally?", "answer": "Yes. In a proprietorship, the firm and the proprietor are legally the same entity. A case for a bounced cheque issued from the firm's account will be filed against both the firm (represented by the proprietor) and you as the proprietor who is personally liable for the firm's debts.", "legal_terms": ["Proprietorship", "Liability", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "The seller supplied goods without any invoice. Now they are claiming a huge amount. Do I have to pay?", "answer": "A seller must provide an invoice or bill as proof of sale and the amount due. Without an invoice or a statement of account, it is very difficult for them to prove the transaction and the liability. The burden is on them to prove the debt, and a lack of invoices severely weakens their case.", "legal_terms": ["Invoice", "Burden of Proof", "Recovery of Money"]}
{"question": "A seller is claiming interest on a payment that's been due for a long time. Is this valid if it's a commercial transaction?", "answer": "In commercial transactions, even if there is no express contract for interest, courts may award 'pendente lite' (during the suit) and future interest at a reasonable rate (e.g., 12% per annum). This is because in business, delayed payment means a loss of capital for the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Commercial Transaction", "Pendente Lite Interest"]}
{"question": "My supplier is based in Bangalore, but they delivered defective goods to me in Kerala. Can I file a suit in Kerala?", "answer": "Yes, you can likely file a suit in Kerala. The 'cause of action' arises where the offer was made, where the acceptance was communicated, where the goods were delivered, or where payment was made. Since the goods were delivered to you in Kerala, a part of the cause of action arose there, giving Kerala courts jurisdiction.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Place of Delivery"]}
{"question": "The seller admits in court that they sometimes issue credit notes for defective goods. How does this admission help my case?", "answer": "This admission strengthens your argument that it was a standard business practice between you to get credit for defective goods. It supports your claim that your current request for a refund or credit for defective items is reasonable and consistent with your past dealings.", "legal_terms": ["Admission", "Course of Dealing", "Evidence", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "Is a contract for 'sale or return' of goods a final sale?", "answer": "No, it is a conditional sale. In a 'sale or return' contract, the ownership of the goods does not pass to you (the buyer) until you signify your approval or acceptance to the seller, or do an act adopting the transaction (like reselling them). Until then, you can return the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Sale or Return", "Conditional Sale"]}
{"question": "A seller is trying to use a previous statement I made in another case against me. Is this allowed?", "answer": "Yes, a statement or admission made by you in a previous legal proceeding (like a petition or affidavit) can be used as evidence against you in a current case. It is considered an admission, and you would be 'estopped' from denying it unless you can provide a very strong explanation.", "legal_terms": ["Admission", "Estoppel", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I was forced to pay compensation to my customers because of defective parts from my supplier. Can I recover this from the supplier?", "answer": "Yes, you can file a claim against your supplier for the damages you had to pay to your customers. You must prove that the supplier's defective parts were the direct cause of the problem, and that the compensation you paid was a reasonable and foreseeable consequence of that defect.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Indemnity", "Causation", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "What is a 'running account' in a business transaction?", "answer": "A 'running account' is a continuous account between a buyer and seller with a series of transactions (debits and credits). Payments are not typically tied to specific invoices but are made against the overall balance. For limitation purposes, the time limit to sue for the balance due often starts from the date of the last transaction or payment.", "legal_terms": ["Running Account", "Open Account", "Limitation Act"]}
{"question": "The seller did not supply C-Forms for an inter-state purchase. Can they charge me the full tax rate?", "answer": "Yes. In inter-state sales, a concessional tax rate is applicable only if the buyer furnishes the required C-Form to the seller. If you fail to provide the C-Form, the seller is liable to pay the full, non-concessional rate of tax and can legally recover that difference from you.", "legal_terms": ["C-Form", "Central Sales Tax Act", "Inter-state Sale"]}
{"question": "A company I bought goods from is a private limited company. Who is legally responsible if the goods are defective?", "answer": "The legal entity responsible is the private limited company itself, not its directors or shareholders personally. You would file a complaint or suit against 'M/s. [Company Name] Pvt. Ltd.' The company is a separate legal person and is liable for its own debts and obligations.", "legal_terms": ["Private Limited Company", "Separate Legal Entity", "Liability"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by a company, but the person who signed the complaint is just a GPA holder, not a director. Is the case valid?", "answer": "Yes, the case is likely valid. A company can authorize a GPA (General Power of Attorney) holder to represent it and file legal complaints on its behalf. As long as there is a valid GPA or a board resolution authorizing that person, the complaint is maintainable.", "legal_terms": ["General Power of Attorney (GPA)", "Authorization", "Maintainability"]}
{"question": "Can a seller who supplied defective goods win a cheque bounce case against me?", "answer": "It is possible. When you issue a cheque, the law presumes it's for a valid debt. To win, you must rebut this presumption by proving, with strong evidence, that the goods were defective and that you therefore owed nothing or a lesser amount. If you fail to prove the defect, the seller can win the cheque bounce case.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Presumption of Liability", "Rebuttal", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I sent a reply to a legal notice denying liability for a bounced cheque. Will this help my case?", "answer": "Yes, sending a timely reply to a legal notice is very important. It allows you to state your defense (e.g., defective goods) at the earliest opportunity. If you don't reply, the court might assume that you had no defense at that time and that your later claims are an afterthought.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Reply", "Defense", "Afterthought"]}
{"question": "The seller is suing me over four invoices, but I only made a part payment. Does that mean I've accepted all four invoices?", "answer": "Not necessarily. A part payment, unless specified otherwise, is usually applied to the oldest outstanding debt. It does not automatically mean you have admitted liability for all four invoices, especially if some of them are in dispute due to defective goods.", "legal_terms": ["Part-Payment", "Appropriation of Payments", "Invoice", "Liability"]}
{"question": "The seller I'm in a dispute with had promised to replace defective goods but hasn't. What can I do?", "answer": "A promise to replace defective goods is an admission of the defect. If the seller fails to honor this promise, you can use their communication (emails, letters) as evidence in a consumer complaint or civil suit to enforce the replacement or claim a refund for the value of the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Breach of Promise", "Evidence", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "I bought an electronic item that was 'dead on arrival'. The seller says I have to go to the service center. Is this correct?", "answer": "While the warranty might direct you to a service center for repairs, a product that is defective from the very beginning ('dead on arrival') is a clear case of being supplied a non-functional product. You have a strong case to demand an immediate replacement or full refund directly from the seller, as they failed to provide a merchantable good.", "legal_terms": ["Dead on Arrival (DOA)", "Merchantable Quality", "Defective Goods", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "A seller charged me on an invoice for goods I never received. How can I prove I didn't get them?", "answer": "The burden of proof is on the seller to prove delivery. You can ask them to produce a signed delivery receipt, proof of dispatch from a courier, or transporter's records. Your own inventory records and GST returns (like GSTR-2B which shows inward supplies) can also serve as evidence that you never received the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Proof of Delivery", "Burden of Proof", "Invoice", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "The seller is using a computer-generated ledger as proof against me. Can I challenge it?", "answer": "Yes, you can challenge it. For a computer-generated document to be admissible as evidence, it must be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act. You can also challenge its accuracy by pointing out discrepancies, showing it was created much later, or by presenting your own, more reliable, set of accounts.", "legal_terms": ["Electronic Evidence", "Section 65B Certificate", "Ledger Account", "Admissibility"]}
{"question": "The seller agreed to settle our dispute for a lower amount, but then backed out. Can I enforce the settlement?", "answer": "If the settlement was just a verbal discussion, it is very hard to enforce. However, if you have a written agreement, signed minutes of a meeting, or a clear email exchange confirming the settlement terms, you can present this to the court as a concluded agreement that should be honored.", "legal_terms": ["Settlement Agreement", "Enforceability", "Concluded Contract", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "My business reputation has suffered because of a supplier's faulty products. Can I claim compensation for this loss of goodwill?", "answer": "Claiming for loss of reputation or goodwill is considered a claim for 'indirect' or 'consequential' damages. It is often difficult to prove and quantify. Unless your contract with the supplier specifically allows for such claims, courts are generally hesitant to award compensation for reputational damage in a standard commercial dispute.", "legal_terms": ["Goodwill", "Consequential Damages", "Reputation", "Damages"]}
{"question": "In a legal dispute, who has the 'burden of proof' when it comes to defective goods?", "answer": "Initially, the burden of proof is on you, the buyer, to establish a prima facie case that the goods are defective. You must provide some evidence. Once you do that, the burden can shift to the seller to prove that the goods were not defective or that the defect was your fault.", "legal_terms": ["Burden of Proof", "Evidence Act", "Defective Goods", "Prima Facie"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a warranty and a guarantee?", "answer": "Legally, a 'warranty' is a promise that the goods are of a certain quality, and a breach of warranty usually entitles you to damages (like repair or compensation). A 'guarantee' is a stronger promise, and a breach can sometimes allow you to reject the goods entirely and get a full replacement or refund. However, the terms are often used interchangeably, and the specific wording in your contract is what matters most.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Guarantee", "Breach of Contract", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "Can I return goods if they don't match the description, even if they are not technically broken?", "answer": "Yes. Under the Sale of Goods Act, there is an implied condition that the goods must correspond with the description under which they were sold. If you ordered a specific model or type and received something different, you have the right to reject the goods, as this is a breach of a fundamental condition of the contract.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Sale by Description", "Breach of Condition", "Right to Reject"]}
{"question": "I'm a small business owner. Can I file a complaint in a Consumer Court?", "answer": "Yes, you can. A small business owner who buys goods can be considered a 'consumer' as long as the goods are not for a 'commercial purpose' of large-scale resale. If you buy goods for self-employment or to use in your own business (like a printer for your office), you are eligible to file a complaint in the Consumer Court.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer", "Commercial Purpose", "Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "The seller is trying to avoid liability by saying their contract has an 'entire agreement clause'. What does this mean?", "answer": "An 'entire agreement clause' means that only the terms written within the formal contract are legally binding. It prevents either party from making claims based on verbal promises, emails, or discussions that happened during negotiations but were not included in the final signed contract. It aims to ensure that the written contract is the complete and final agreement.", "legal_terms": ["Entire Agreement Clause", "Contract Interpretation", "Parol Evidence Rule"]}
{"question": "Is an oral agreement to supply goods legally valid?", "answer": "Yes, an oral agreement is legally valid and enforceable under the Indian Contract Act. However, it is extremely difficult to prove in court. Without any written evidence like emails, purchase orders, or invoices, the existence and terms of the agreement become a matter of 'he said, she said', which makes legal action very challenging.", "legal_terms": ["Oral Agreement", "Indian Contract Act", "Evidence", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller took a cheque from me but is delaying its presentation in the bank. Is there a time limit?", "answer": "Yes, a cheque is valid for three months from the date written on it. The seller (payee) must present it to the bank within this period. If they fail to do so, the cheque becomes 'stale' and the bank will not honor it.", "legal_terms": ["Cheque Validity", "Stale Cheque", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "Can a seller sue me for payment if they supplied goods that were not fit for the specific purpose I told them I needed them for?", "answer": "No, they would have a very weak case. If you expressly told the seller the specific purpose for which you needed the goods, relying on their skill and judgment, there is an implied condition under the Sale of Goods Act that the goods will be fit for that purpose. If they are not, you are not liable to pay and can even counter-sue for damages.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Implied Condition", "Fitness for Purpose", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "I found out a seller sent me defective goods. How quickly do I need to complain?", "answer": "You should complain as soon as you discover the defect. The law requires you to act within a 'reasonable time'. Unreasonable delay can be used against you, with the seller arguing that you accepted the goods by not complaining earlier. Prompt written communication is key.", "legal_terms": ["Reasonable Time", "Notification of Defect", "Laches"]}
{"question": "The seller is a partnership firm. Who should I name in my legal complaint?", "answer": "You should name the partnership firm itself (e.g., 'M/s. ABC Enterprises') and you can also name its partners. This is because, in a partnership, the partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the firm.", "legal_terms": ["Partnership Firm", "Joint and Several Liability", "Parties to a Suit"]}
{"question": "I am being sued for an amount that includes tax, but the seller never provided the required tax forms. Is this correct?", "answer": "If the transaction required you to provide a tax form (like a C-Form) to get a lower tax rate, and you failed to do so, the seller is legally entitled to claim the higher tax amount from you. The liability to pay the full tax falls on the seller if the form is not furnished, and they can pass that cost on to you.", "legal_terms": ["Tax Liability", "C-Form", "Central Sales Tax Act"]}
{"question": "What does it mean when a court says a finding is 'perverse'?", "answer": "A finding is considered 'perverse' if it is so irrational or unsupported by the evidence on record that no reasonable person could have reached that conclusion. It's a high standard, but if an arbitrator's or lower court's finding is deemed perverse, an appellate court can set it aside.", "legal_terms": ["Perverse Finding", "Appellate Review", "Arbitration"]}
{"question": "I returned defective goods but the seller is still suing me for the full price. What is my best defense?", "answer": "Your best defense is to provide concrete proof of the return. This could be a signed receipt from the seller acknowledging the return, a credit note issued by them, or tracking information from a courier. Without proof that the goods were actually returned and received by the seller, it is very difficult to defend against their claim for payment.", "legal_terms": ["Proof of Return", "Defective Goods", "Evidence", "Defense"]}
{"question": "Can a company avoid a cheque bounce case by claiming the director who signed the cheque has left the company?", "answer": "No. The liability for a cheque bounce lies with the company and the persons who were in charge of its affairs at the time the cheque was issued and the offence was committed. A director cannot escape liability simply by resigning after the cheque has bounced.", "legal_terms": ["Vicarious Liability", "Section 141 NI Act", "Director's Liability"]}
{"question": "The seller's invoice has very fine print on the back with many conditions. Are these legally binding?", "answer": "Yes, terms and conditions printed on an invoice can be legally binding, especially in commercial transactions where there is a history of dealings. By accepting the invoice and the goods without objecting to those terms, you are often considered to have implicitly agreed to them.", "legal_terms": ["Fine Print", "Invoice Terms", "Implied Consent", "Contract"]}
{"question": "If my cheque bounces for 'funds insufficient', can I later claim the goods were defective as a defense?", "answer": "Yes, you can. The reason for dishonor given by the bank ('funds insufficient') does not prevent you from raising the defense of defective goods in court. You will still need to prove the defects to show you had no legally enforceable debt to pay, but the reason on the bank memo is not the final word on your liability.", "legal_terms": ["Funds Insufficient", "Defective Goods", "Defense", "Section 138"]}
{"question": "What is 'privity of contract' and how does it affect me if I buy from a reseller?", "answer": "'Privity of contract' is a legal principle that states only the parties to a contract can sue each other under it. If you buy from a reseller, your contract is with the reseller, not the original manufacturer. If the product is defective, you must sue the reseller. The reseller, in turn, will sue the manufacturer based on their separate contract.", "legal_terms": ["Privity of Contract", "Reseller", "Manufacturer", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "A seller is suing me for a debt. Can the court order them to pay my legal costs if I win?", "answer": "Yes. The court has the discretion to order the losing party to pay the legal costs of the winning party. This is a standard practice to compensate the winner for the expenses incurred in litigation. In consumer cases, the commission can also award costs.", "legal_terms": ["Costs of Suit", "Civil Procedure Code", "Discretion of Court"]}
{"question": "The seller is trying to prove I received goods using a lorry receipt (LR). Is an LR conclusive proof of delivery?", "answer": "A lorry receipt (LR) or consignment note is strong evidence of dispatch of goods, but not conclusive proof of delivery to you. To be effective, it should ideally be supported by an acknowledgment of receipt signed by you or your authorized representative.", "legal_terms": ["Lorry Receipt", "Proof of Delivery", "Consignment Note", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "A seller won a cheque bounce case against me. Do I have to pay the fine to the government or the seller?", "answer": "The court will specify this in its order. Under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C., the court can direct that the fine amount be paid as compensation to the complainant (the seller). Usually, a major portion of the fine is given as compensation to the victim, and a smaller portion may be remitted to the State.", "legal_terms": ["Compensation", "Fine", "Section 357 CrPC", "Section 138"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a 'civil' case and a 'criminal' case for a defective product issue?", "answer": "A civil case (like in a consumer court or civil court) is for compensation, refund, or replacement. A criminal case, like a cheque bounce case under Section 138 NI Act, is to punish the offender with a fine or imprisonment for the act of issuing a bad cheque. Both can sometimes proceed simultaneously based on the same transaction.", "legal_terms": ["Civil Suit", "Criminal Complaint", "Remedy", "Punishment"]}
{"question": "The seller's goods had 'finger prints' and 'base fog' defects. What kind of defects are these?", "answer": "These are manufacturing defects. 'Base fog' on photographic film means it's not clear, and 'finger prints' indicate handling issues during production. Both make the product unfit for its purpose and are valid grounds for a defective goods claim.", "legal_terms": ["Manufacturing Defect", "Defective Goods", "Fit for Purpose"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by a company whose name has changed. Does this affect the case?", "answer": "No, a change in the company's name does not affect its legal rights or liabilities. The new entity inherits all the legal cases of the old entity. The court will simply record the name change (e.g., 'amended as per order...'), and the case will continue as normal.", "legal_terms": ["Change of Name", "Amalgamation", "Successor-in-interest"]}
{"question": "Can I get a case dismissed because the other party took too long to file it?", "answer": "Yes, if they filed it after the statutory 'period of limitation' has expired. For most commercial disputes, this period is three years from the date the cause of action arose. If the case is filed beyond this time, you can ask the court to dismiss it as being 'barred by limitation'.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Barred by Limitation", "Period of Limitation"]}
{"question": "The seller has produced emails as evidence, but I suspect they are forged. What can I do?", "answer": "You can challenge the authenticity of the emails in court. You can argue they don't have the required Section 65B certificate, you can cross-examine the person who produced them about their source, and you can file a police complaint for forgery if you have strong reasons to believe they are fabricated.", "legal_terms": ["Forgery", "Electronic Evidence", "Section 65B Certificate", "Cross-examination"]}
{"question": "Does a 'stop payment' instruction on a cheque have the same legal consequence as 'insufficient funds'?", "answer": "Yes. For the purpose of a Section 138 NI Act offense, a cheque dishonored due to a 'stop payment' instruction is treated the same as one dishonored for 'insufficient funds'. The legal presumption of liability still applies, and the drawer must prove they had a valid reason to stop the payment.", "legal_terms": ["Stop Payment", "Insufficient Funds", "Section 138", "Dishonour of Cheque"]}
{"question": "I am involved in arbitration over defective goods. Is the arbitrator's decision final?", "answer": "The arbitrator's decision (the 'award') is generally final and binding. You can only challenge it in court on very limited grounds, such as the arbitrator acting without jurisdiction, violating principles of natural justice, or the award being against the public policy of India. You cannot appeal it simply because you disagree with the factual findings.", "legal_terms": ["Arbitration", "Arbitral Award", "Setting Aside of Award", "Jurisdiction of Arbitrator"]}
{"question": "The seller and I have an 'arbitration clause' in our contract. Can I still go to a consumer court?", "answer": "Yes. The Supreme Court has held that an arbitration clause in a contract does not bar a consumer from approaching a consumer court. The remedy under the Consumer Protection Act is an additional remedy, and you have the choice to either go for arbitration or file a complaint in the consumer forum.", "legal_terms": ["Arbitration Clause", "Consumer Protection Act", "Jurisdiction", "Additional Remedy"]}
{"question": "In a dispute, my supplier's expert gave an opinion in their favor. Is the court bound by this expert opinion?", "answer": "No, the court is not bound by an expert's opinion. An expert's role is to provide specialized knowledge to help the court understand technical matters. The final decision rests with the judge, who will evaluate the expert's testimony along with all other evidence on record.", "legal_terms": ["Expert Opinion", "Evidence Act", "Admissibility", "Role of Expert"]}
{"question": "I returned defective goods, but the seller claims I damaged them by mishandling. How do I defend this?", "answer": "You can defend this by showing the goods were in their original, sealed packaging when the defect was noticed, or that the defect is a manufacturing flaw (like a chemical imbalance in film) that could not have been caused by you. If you have evidence that other customers had similar issues, it would also strengthen your case.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Mishandling", "Manufacturing Defect", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "What is a 'bona fide' dispute in the context of a winding-up petition?", "answer": "A 'bona fide' or 'good faith' dispute is a genuine, substantial, and non-frivolous disagreement over a debt. If you can show the court you have a real defense (like the goods being defective), the debt is considered 'disputed'. A winding-up petition cannot be maintained for a debt that is subject to a bona fide dispute.", "legal_terms": ["Bona Fide Dispute", "Winding-up Petition", "Disputed Debt", "Companies Act"]}
{"question": "The seller took a security cheque from me. They are now trying to encash it even though I have cleared all my dues. What should I do?", "answer": "Immediately instruct your bank to 'stop payment' on the cheque. Simultaneously, send a legal notice to the seller demanding the return of the cheque, stating that there are no outstanding dues. If they still pursue legal action, you can defend it by providing proof of full payment, such as bank statements and account ledgers.", "legal_terms": ["Security Cheque", "Stop Payment", "Legal Notice", "No Dues"]}
{"question": "A court has ordered my company to pay a large sum for defective goods. Can the directors be made to pay from their personal assets?", "answer": "Generally, no. A private limited company is a separate legal entity, and its directors are not personally liable for its debts. The liability is limited to the company's assets. Personal liability can only arise in specific cases of fraud or if a director has given a personal guarantee for the debt.", "legal_terms": ["Limited Liability", "Separate Legal Entity", "Director's Liability", "Personal Guarantee"]}
{"question": "The seller claims I made a verbal order over the phone. I deny it. Who has to prove the order was placed?", "answer": "The burden of proof is on the seller (the plaintiff) to prove that an order was placed. In the absence of a written purchase order or any confirmatory email, it is very difficult for them to prove a verbal order if you deny it. Their case becomes very weak without documentary evidence.", "legal_terms": ["Verbal Order", "Burden of Proof", "Evidence", "Contract"]}
{"question": "Can I claim a refund for goods that are of 'unmerchantable quality'?", "answer": "Yes. 'Merchantable quality' is an implied condition in a sale, meaning the goods must be fit for their ordinary purpose. If they are not (e.g., sprinklers that rust, film that is foggy), they are unmerchantable. You can reject them and claim a full refund or damages.", "legal_terms": ["Merchantable Quality", "Sale of Goods Act", "Implied Condition", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I am being sued in a court in Delhi, but I live and work in Mumbai and the goods were delivered in Mumbai. Is this correct?", "answer": "It depends. For a court in Delhi to have jurisdiction, some part of the 'cause of action' must have arisen in Delhi. For example, if the contract was signed in Delhi or payment was made to a bank account in Delhi. If the entire transaction took place in Mumbai, the Delhi court would not have territorial jurisdiction to hear the case.", "legal_terms": ["Territorial Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Civil Procedure Code"]}
{"question": "What does it mean for a legal presumption to be 'rebuttable'?", "answer": "A 'rebuttable presumption' is an assumption the law makes that is taken to be true unless someone proves otherwise. In a cheque bounce case, the law presumes the cheque was for a valid debt. The accused can 'rebut' or challenge this presumption by presenting evidence to the contrary (like proof of defective goods).", "legal_terms": ["Rebuttable Presumption", "Burden of Proof", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "I received a legal notice, but it claims interest and other charges on top of the cheque amount. Is the notice invalid?", "answer": "No, the notice is likely still valid. As long as the notice clearly demands the amount of the cheque, including additional claims for interest or costs does not invalidate it. These additional claims are considered 'severable' (separable) from the main demand for the cheque amount.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Severable Claim", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "I issued a cheque which was dishonored. The other party did not send me a legal notice within 30 days. Can they still file a case?", "answer": "No. Sending a legal demand notice to the drawer of the cheque within 30 days of receiving the dishonor information from the bank is a mandatory requirement under Section 138 of the NI Act. Failure to do so means they lose their right to file a criminal complaint for that specific instance of dishonor.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Time Limit", "Section 138", "Mandatory Requirement"]}
{"question": "The seller supplied me with sanitary ware that was cracked. Is this a valid reason to stop payment on a cheque?", "answer": "Yes, supplying cracked or damaged sanitary ware is a clear case of providing defective goods. You can stop payment on the cheque, but you must be prepared to prove the defects in court if the seller files a cheque bounce case. Take photographs and inform the seller in writing immediately.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Stop Payment", "Evidence", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "Can an appeal court change the sentence given by a trial court in a cheque bounce case?", "answer": "Yes, an appellate court has the power to review and modify the sentence passed by the trial court. It can increase, decrease, or change the nature of the punishment (e.g., from imprisonment to only a fine), based on the facts and circumstances of the case and principles of justice.", "legal_terms": ["Appeal", "Sentence", "Appellate Court", "Modification of Order"]}
{"question": "In a dispute, the seller says I should have filed a written complaint with them. Is this a legal requirement?", "answer": "While not always a strict legal requirement, it is a crucial practical step. Courts give significant weight to whether the buyer provided a prompt written complaint to the seller. Failing to do so can weaken your case, as it may be argued that you accepted the goods or that your claim is an afterthought.", "legal_terms": ["Written Complaint", "Evidence", "Afterthought", "Duty to Notify"]}
{"question": "What does 'estoppel' mean in a legal case?", "answer": "'Estoppel' is a legal principle that prevents a person from arguing something or asserting a right that contradicts what they previously said or did. For example, if you admitted a debt in a previous letter, you are 'estopped' from later denying that debt in court without a very good reason.", "legal_terms": ["Estoppel", "Admission", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "A seller is suing me for a very high amount of interest. Can I challenge it?", "answer": "Yes, you can challenge the rate of interest. If the rate is not specified in a written contract, or if it is excessively high ('penal' in nature), the court has the power to reduce it to a more reasonable rate based on prevailing bank rates and the nature of the transaction.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Penal Interest", "Reasonable Rate", "Contract Act"]}
{"question": "I have been dealing with a person who claims to be the seller's agent. How can I know if he can legally bind the seller?", "answer": "You should ask for proof of his authority, such as a Power of Attorney or a letter from the company. A person is only a 'commercial agent' if they have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of their principal (the seller). A person who is just a 'commission agent' or a salesman may not have the power to make binding promises.", "legal_terms": ["Agent", "Principal", "Apparent Authority", "Power of Attorney"]}
{"question": "The seller is a proprietorship concern. Who do I sue, the firm or the owner?", "answer": "You should sue both. The proper way is to name the firm as the first defendant, represented by its proprietor, and then name the proprietor as the second defendant in their personal capacity. For example, 'M/s ABC Enterprises, through its Proprietor, Mr. John Doe' and 'Mr. John Doe'.", "legal_terms": ["Proprietorship", "Parties to a Suit", "Liability"]}
{"question": "A DVD player I bought was defective and couldn't be sold. The seller is suing me for the price. What's my defense?", "answer": "Your defense is that there was a 'failure of consideration'. You did not receive a product of merchantable quality that was fit for its purpose. You should have evidence of the defect and that you notified the seller. You can argue that you are not liable to pay for a non-functional item.", "legal_terms": ["Failure of Consideration", "Defective Goods", "Merchantable Quality", "Defense"]}
{"question": "I have been acquitted in a cheque bounce case. What happens to the bail bond I furnished?", "answer": "Upon acquittal, the court will order the cancellation of your bail bond and surety bond. You and your surety are then discharged from your obligations under the bond.", "legal_terms": ["Acquittal", "Bail Bond", "Surety", "Discharge"]}
{"question": "The seller's witness has given contradictory statements in court. How does this help me?", "answer": "Contradictory statements from a witness weaken their credibility and the overall case of the party they are representing. You can highlight these contradictions during your final arguments to show the court that the witness's testimony is unreliable and should not be believed.", "legal_terms": ["Contradiction", "Cross-examination", "Credibility of Witness", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I am being sued in a civil court for money. I have also been charged in a criminal court for a bounced cheque for the same transaction. Is this double jeopardy?", "answer": "No, this is not double jeopardy. A civil suit for recovery of money and a criminal complaint for a bounced cheque are distinct legal remedies. The civil case aims for compensation, while the criminal case aims for punishment. Both can proceed independently and simultaneously.", "legal_terms": ["Double Jeopardy", "Civil Remedy", "Criminal Remedy", "Parallel Proceedings"]}
{"question": "Can I claim a refund for defective goods if the sale was on a 'said to contain' basis?", "answer": "A 'said to contain' basis clause usually protects the seller regarding the quantity or exact contents inside a sealed package. However, it does not typically absolve them from the liability to provide goods of a certain quality. If the goods are defective, you can still claim a remedy, as this relates to quality, not just the description on the package.", "legal_terms": ["Said to Contain", "Warranty of Quality", "Contract Clause", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My supplier is claiming damages for non-payment, but they have also sold the goods to someone else. How does this affect their claim?", "answer": "If they have mitigated their loss by selling the goods to someone else, their claim for damages against you would be reduced. They can generally only claim the difference between the contract price with you and the price they received from the new buyer, plus any incidental expenses. They cannot claim the full contract price.", "legal_terms": ["Mitigation of Damages", "Breach of Contract", "Damages", "Resale"]}
{"question": "The seller has not denied that my company returned some defective goods. What is the legal effect of this?", "answer": "If a fact alleged by you is not specifically denied by the other party in their pleadings (written statement), it can be treated as an admission. Their failure to deny the return of defective goods strengthens your position that the goods were indeed faulty and returned.", "legal_terms": ["Admission by Non-denial", "Pleadings", "Evidence Act"]}
{"question": "What is the 'preponderance of probabilities' standard of proof?", "answer": "This is the standard of proof required in most civil cases. It means you have to show that your version of events is more likely to be true than not (i.e., there is a more than 50% probability). It is a lower standard than 'beyond a reasonable doubt', which is used in criminal cases.", "legal_terms": ["Preponderance of Probabilities", "Standard of Proof", "Burden of Proof", "Civil Case"]}
{"question": "Can I be convicted for a bounced cheque if the seller filed the complaint after the one-month deadline?", "answer": "No. A complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act must be filed within one month from the date on which the 15-day notice period for payment expires. If the complaint is filed after this deadline, it is barred by limitation and the court cannot take cognizance of the offense.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Period", "Section 142 NI Act", "Cause of Action", "Cognizance"]}
{"question": "A seller in Chennai is suing me in a Chennai court, but I placed the order from Kerala and they delivered it there. Do I have to go to Chennai?", "answer": "Not necessarily. You can challenge the territorial jurisdiction of the Chennai court. Since the order was placed from Kerala and goods were delivered there, a significant part of the cause of action arose in Kerala. The court will decide if it has jurisdiction. If the contract specifies Chennai courts have exclusive jurisdiction, the situation is different.", "legal_terms": ["Territorial Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Exclusive Jurisdiction Clause"]}
{"question": "Is it mandatory to issue a purchase order in writing for a sale to be valid?", "answer": "No, a purchase order is not mandatory for a valid sale. A contract of sale can be made orally or implied from the conduct of the parties. However, a written purchase order is strong evidence of the contract and its terms, and its absence makes it harder for the seller to prove the transaction if it is disputed.", "legal_terms": ["Purchase Order", "Oral Contract", "Evidence", "Contract of Sale"]}
{"question": "My supplier sent me defective goods, and my own customers are now complaining. Can I use their complaints as evidence against my supplier?", "answer": "Yes, complaints from your end-customers can be used as evidence to show that the goods supplied were defective. It is helpful to have these complaints in writing (emails, letters). You may even need to have one of your customers testify as a witness to strengthen your case against the original supplier.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Third-Party Complaint", "Defective Goods", "Witness"]}
{"question": "The seller is trying to charge me a 24% interest rate. Can the court reduce this?", "answer": "Yes, a court can reduce an interest rate if it finds it to be exorbitant or penal in nature. Even if an invoice mentions a high rate like 24%, if it's not part of a formally signed agreement, a court is likely to award interest at a more reasonable commercial rate, such as 9% to 12% per annum.", "legal_terms": ["Interest Rate", "Penal Interest", "Reasonable Rate", "Discretion of Court"]}
{"question": "The seller is demanding payment for goods supplied, but they did not provide a warranty. Are they still liable for defects?", "answer": "Yes. Even without an express written warranty, the law implies certain conditions into a contract of sale. These include the condition that the goods must be of 'merchantable quality' and 'fit for the purpose' for which they are sold. If they are defective, the seller is liable under these implied warranties.", "legal_terms": ["Implied Warranty", "Sale of Goods Act", "Merchantable Quality", "Fitness for Purpose"]}
{"question": "What happens if a cheque is dishonored because the 'signature differs'?", "answer": "A cheque dishonored for 'signature differs' is also an offense under Section 138 of the NI Act, just like 'insufficient funds'. The legal presumption of liability is still drawn against the drawer of the cheque. It is up to the drawer to prove that the signature is not theirs or was forged.", "legal_terms": ["Signature Differs", "Dishonour of Cheque", "Section 138", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by a company. Can I demand to see their board resolution authorizing the lawsuit?", "answer": "Yes, you can. You have the right to challenge the authority of the person representing the company. If they cannot produce a valid board resolution or Power of Attorney authorizing them to file the suit, you can argue that the suit is not maintainable.", "legal_terms": ["Board Resolution", "Authorization", "Maintainability", "Locus Standi"]}
{"question": "My supplier sent me steel coils that were not suitable for 'continuous coil cutting' as required. Is this a breach of contract?", "answer": "Yes, if the contract or understanding between you was that the steel should be suitable for a specific process like 'continuous coil cutting', then supplying material unfit for that process is a breach of the implied condition of fitness for a particular purpose under the Sale of Goods Act. You can claim damages for this breach.", "legal_terms": ["Fitness for Purpose", "Breach of Condition", "Sale of Goods Act", "Damages"]}
{"question": "Can I get a refund for defective goods even after the warranty period has expired?", "answer": "It is very difficult. Once the express warranty period expires, your right to claim a remedy under that warranty is lost. You might have a case if you can prove a 'latent defect' that existed from the beginning but could not have been discovered during the warranty period, but this is a complex legal argument to win.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty Period", "Latent Defect", "Statute of Limitations"]}
{"question": "The seller sent me a legal notice demanding payment. Do I have to reply through a lawyer?", "answer": "While it is not mandatory to reply through a lawyer, it is highly advisable. A lawyer can draft a legally sound reply that protects your rights and clearly states your defense without making any unintended admissions. A well-drafted reply sets the stage for your future legal defense.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Reply", "Legal Advice"]}
{"question": "A court dismissed my suit because it found it had no 'territorial jurisdiction'. What does this mean and what can I do?", "answer": "It means you filed the case in the wrong city or state. The court did not have the geographical authority to hear your case. This is not a judgment on the merits of your case. You can file a fresh suit in the correct court that has the proper jurisdiction over the matter.", "legal_terms": ["Territorial Jurisdiction", "Dismissal of Suit", "Cause of Action"]}
{"question": "What is the legal effect of an 'ex-parte' decree?", "answer": "An 'ex-parte' decree is a judgment passed in favor of the plaintiff when the defendant fails to appear in court. However, it is not final. The defendant can file an application to have the ex-parte decree set aside by showing the court they had a sufficient cause for not appearing. If the application is allowed, the case is reopened.", "legal_terms": ["Ex-Parte Decree", "Setting Aside", "Civil Procedure Code"]}
{"question": "I have been asked to testify as a witness in a consumer case. What is 'cross-examination'?", "answer": "'Cross-examination' is the questioning of a witness by the opposing party's lawyer after the witness has given their primary testimony. The purpose is to test the truthfulness and accuracy of the witness's statements, bring out facts favorable to the opposing party, and discredit the witness or their testimony.", "legal_terms": ["Witness", "Cross-examination", "Evidence Act", "Testimony"]}
{"question": "My seller is a 'commission agent'. Can I hold him responsible for the defective goods from the manufacturer?", "answer": "Generally, a commission agent is just a facilitator and not the seller. Your contract is with the manufacturer (the principal). However, if the agent did not disclose the principal's name or acted as if they were the seller, you might be able to hold the agent liable. The specific facts of your arrangement are important.", "legal_terms": ["Commission Agent", "Principal", "Agency Law", "Liability"]}
{"question": "I gave a post-dated cheque for goods, but they turned out to be defective before the cheque's date. Can I stop the payment?", "answer": "Yes, you can. Your liability to pay depends on whether the seller has fulfilled their side of the contract. If they supplied defective goods, you have a valid reason to stop payment on the post-dated cheque. You must be prepared to prove the defect if they file a cheque bounce case.", "legal_terms": ["Post-Dated Cheque", "Stop Payment", "Defective Goods", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "The seller's agreement says any dispute will be settled by arbitration in Mumbai. Can I file a consumer complaint in my city, Pune?", "answer": "Yes, you can. The Supreme Court has clarified that an arbitration clause does not prevent a consumer from seeking remedies under the Consumer Protection Act. You can choose to either go for arbitration as per the agreement or file a complaint at the Consumer Commission in Pune, where you reside.", "legal_terms": ["Arbitration Clause", "Consumer Protection Act", "Choice of Forum", "Jurisdiction"]}
{"question": "A seller is charging me for overhead expenses like advertising and storage for goods I bought. Is this legal?", "answer": "No. Once you buy goods and the ownership passes to you, expenses like storage and advertising are your own business costs. A seller cannot claim these from you as part of a breach of contract dispute. Such claims for overheads are generally not allowed.", "legal_terms": ["Overhead Expenses", "Damages", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "My supplier in India sent defective goods to my buyer in the USA. Where is the 'market' for calculating my loss?", "answer": "This depends on what the supplier knew. If your supplier knew the goods were specifically for the US market and for resale there, the court may consider the US market price for calculating damages. Otherwise, the default rule is the market price at the place of shipment (the 'FOB' price in India).", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Market Price", "FOB Contract", "Contemplation of Parties"]}
{"question": "I bought defective goods and now the seller's company has merged with another. Who do I sue?", "answer": "You should sue the new, merged company. When companies merge (amalgamate), the new entity inherits all the assets and, importantly, all the liabilities of the old companies. The new company is now responsible for the defective goods supplied by the old one.", "legal_terms": ["Amalgamation", "Merger", "Successor Liability", "Companies Act"]}
{"question": "What is the penalty for filing a frivolous or vexatious consumer complaint?", "answer": "Under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, if the Consumer Commission finds that a complaint is frivolous or vexatious (filed without any real basis, just to harass the other party), it can dismiss the complaint and order the complainant to pay a penalty of up to ten thousand rupees to the opposite party.", "legal_terms": ["Frivolous Complaint", "Vexatious Litigation", "Consumer Protection Act", "Penalty"]}
{"question": "Can I get my cheque bounce case settled even after being convicted by the trial court?", "answer": "Yes, it is possible. A settlement (compounding of offence) can be reached at any stage, including during an appeal against the conviction. If you and the complainant agree to a settlement, you can present it to the appellate court, which can then acquit you on the basis of the compromise.", "legal_terms": ["Compounding of Offence", "Appeal", "Settlement", "Acquittal"]}
{"question": "The seller claims I accepted defective goods because I kept them for a long time without complaining. Is this true?", "answer": "Yes, this can be true. Under the Sale of Goods Act, if you retain goods for a reasonable time after delivery without informing the seller that you have rejected them, you are deemed to have accepted them. What constitutes a 'reasonable time' depends on the nature of the goods and the facts of the case.", "legal_terms": ["Deemed Acceptance", "Sale of Goods Act", "Reasonable Time", "Rejection of Goods"]}
{"question": "What does 'without prejudice' mean when written on a settlement offer letter?", "answer": "'Without prejudice' is a legal term meaning that the letter's contents cannot be used as evidence or admission of liability in court if the settlement fails. It allows parties to negotiate freely without fear that their offers of compromise will be used against them later.", "legal_terms": ["Without Prejudice", "Settlement Negotiation", "Evidence", "Admission"]}
{"question": "The seller has not provided any bills for the goods supplied. Can they still win a case for recovery of money?", "answer": "It would be extremely difficult for them. An invoice or bill is the primary document to prove a sale and the amount due. Without any bills, statements of account, or other documentary proof, the seller has a very high burden to prove that a transaction even took place and the amount of your liability.", "legal_terms": ["Invoice", "Burden of Proof", "Documentary Evidence", "Recovery Suit"]}
{"question": "I am being sued in a civil court and the company's director is testifying. Can I ask him about his personal knowledge of the transactions?", "answer": "Yes, absolutely. During cross-examination, you can question the director to check his personal knowledge of the specific transactions, invoices, and communications. If he has no direct knowledge and is only relying on company records, it can weaken the credibility of his testimony.", "legal_terms": ["Cross-examination", "Personal Knowledge", "Witness Testimony", "Credibility"]}
{"question": "If I win a case against a seller for defective goods, can I claim the interest I lost on the money I paid them?", "answer": "Yes. When a court awards a refund or damages, it also usually awards interest on that amount. You can claim pre-litigation interest (from the date the money was due), pendente lite interest (during the case), and future interest (from the date of the judgment until payment) at a reasonable rate.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Damages", "Refund", "Pendente Lite"]}
{"question": "A product I bought failed just after the 1-year warranty expired. Do I have any rights?", "answer": "Your rights are very limited after the express warranty period expires. However, if you can prove that the product had a 'latent defect' (a hidden manufacturing flaw that existed from the start), you might still have a claim. This is a difficult argument and would likely require an expert report to prove the defect was inherent and not due to wear and tear.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Warranty Period", "Product Liability"]}
{"question": "My cheque was returned by the bank for a reason other than 'insufficient funds'. Can the seller still file a case under Section 138?", "answer": "Yes. Section 138 of the NI Act covers dishonor for 'insufficient funds' or if 'it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid'. Courts have interpreted this broadly to include other reasons like 'account closed', 'payment stopped', and 'signature differs', as these are all ways a drawer can avoid payment.", "legal_terms": ["Dishonour of Cheque", "Section 138", "Account Closed", "Stop Payment"]}
{"question": "The seller is a large corporation. I'm just a small buyer. Does this affect my chances in court?", "answer": "No. The law is applied equally to everyone, regardless of their size or financial status. The case will be decided based on the evidence presented and the legal merits of the arguments. A small buyer with a strong, well-documented case can certainly win against a large corporation.", "legal_terms": ["Equality before Law", "Evidence", "Merits of the Case"]}
{"question": "What is a 'counterfoil' of a cheque and can it be used as evidence?", "answer": "The counterfoil is the small stub left in the chequebook after you tear out a cheque, where you can note the details. While it can be used as a secondary piece of evidence to show you issued a cheque, it is not strong proof on its own. The primary evidence is the cheque itself and the bank's statement.", "legal_terms": ["Counterfoil", "Evidence", "Cheque"]}
{"question": "I am being sued, and the other party has filed an 'affidavit' as evidence. What is an affidavit?", "answer": "An affidavit is a sworn written statement confirmed by oath or affirmation, made before a person officially permitted to administer oaths. In court, it is used as evidence, particularly for the main testimony of a witness (called 'examination-in-chief'). The person who signs the affidavit must then be made available for cross-examination.", "legal_terms": ["Affidavit", "Evidence", "Examination-in-chief", "Oath"]}
{"question": "The seller's salesman promised me a lifetime warranty, but the official contract says only one year. What is my right?", "answer": "The written contract almost always overrides any verbal promises made by a salesman. If the contract has an 'entire agreement clause', the salesman's promise is legally irrelevant. Your rights are limited to the one-year warranty specified in the signed contract.", "legal_terms": ["Verbal Promise", "Written Contract", "Entire Agreement Clause", "Parol Evidence Rule"]}
{"question": "Can I claim compensation for mental agony and harassment in a defective product case?", "answer": "Yes. In a consumer complaint, apart from the cost of the product, you can claim compensation for the mental agony, harassment, and inconvenience you suffered due to the defective product and the seller's failure to resolve the issue. The Consumer Commission has the power to award a reasonable amount for this.", "legal_terms": ["Mental Agony", "Compensation", "Consumer Protection Act", "Damages"]}
{"question": "What happens if I lose a consumer case at the District Commission?", "answer": "If you are not satisfied with the order of the District Consumer Commission, you have the right to file an appeal before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. This appeal must be filed within 45 days from the date of the order.", "legal_terms": ["Appeal", "District Commission", "State Commission", "Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "I am being sued for a transaction from 2015. The seller filed the case in 2020. Is this allowed?", "answer": "Likely not. The general period of limitation for filing a suit for recovery of money is three years. If the cause of action arose in 2015, a suit filed in 2020 would be 'barred by limitation', unless the seller can prove that you acknowledged the debt in writing or made a part-payment within the three years prior to filing the suit.", "legal_terms": ["Period of Limitation", "Limitation Act", "Barred by Time", "Acknowledgment of Debt"]}
{"question": "The contract I signed has a clause that I cannot return goods once delivered. Is this clause legally valid?", "answer": "This clause may not be legally valid if the goods are defective. The Sale of Goods Act gives you an implied right to reject goods that are not of merchantable quality or fit for purpose. A contractual clause cannot override these fundamental statutory rights, especially if it is an unfair trade practice.", "legal_terms": ["Unfair Contract Term", "Sale of Goods Act", "Implied Condition", "Right to Reject"]}
{"question": "I have a lot of WhatsApp chats with the seller about the defective product. Are these admissible in court?", "answer": "Yes, WhatsApp chats are considered electronic evidence and can be admitted in court. However, you must produce them in a proper format (e.g., printouts) and they must be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act to prove their authenticity.", "legal_terms": ["Electronic Evidence", "WhatsApp Chats", "Section 65B Certificate", "Admissibility"]}
{"question": "The seller is trying to charge me a cancellation fee for an order of defective goods. Do I have to pay?", "answer": "No. If you are cancelling the order because the goods supplied are defective, you are exercising your legal right due to the seller's breach of contract. You are not liable to pay a cancellation fee. The seller is the one at fault.", "legal_terms": ["Cancellation", "Breach of Contract", "Defective Goods", "Penalty Clause"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a 'void' contract and a 'voidable' contract?", "answer": "A 'void' contract is an agreement that is not legally enforceable from the very beginning (e.g., an agreement for an illegal purpose). A 'voidable' contract is a valid contract that can be cancelled or affirmed by one of the parties. For example, a contract based on fraud is voidable at the option of the victim.", "legal_terms": ["Void Contract", "Voidable Contract", "Indian Contract Act", "Enforceability"]}
{"question": "Can a seller be held liable for defects if the goods were damaged in transit by the transporter?", "answer": "It depends on the contract terms. In an FOB (Free on Board) contract, the seller's responsibility ends once the goods are loaded onto the ship. The risk during transit is on the buyer. In a CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) or a 'door delivery' contract, the seller is responsible until the goods reach the buyer's destination.", "legal_terms": ["FOB Contract", "CIF Contract", "Risk in Transit", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "A court has ordered a seller to refund my money, but they are not paying. What is my next step?", "answer": "If the seller does not comply with the court's order (decree), you need to file an 'execution petition' in the same court. The court will then take steps to enforce its order, which can include attaching the seller's bank accounts or seizing and selling their property to recover the money owed to you.", "legal_terms": ["Execution Petition", "Decree", "Attachment of Property", "Enforcement of Order"]}
{"question": "I paid by cheque. The cheque was cleared by my bank, but the goods turned out to be defective. Can I still get a refund?", "answer": "Yes, absolutely. The fact that the cheque was cleared only means the payment has been made. It does not mean you have accepted the defective goods or given up your right to a remedy. You can still file a consumer complaint or a civil suit for a refund or damages based on the defective nature of the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Refund", "Consumer Complaint", "Breach of Warranty"]}
{"question": "The seller claims that since I am a business and not an individual, I cannot be a 'consumer'. Is this correct?", "answer": "This is not entirely correct. A business entity (like a proprietorship, partnership, or even a company) can be a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, provided that the goods or services were purchased for its own use and not for the purpose of large-scale commercial resale.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer", "Commercial Purpose", "Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "I am in a legal dispute and the other side is intentionally delaying the case. What can I do?", "answer": "You can file an application with the court to expedite the hearing. You can point out the delaying tactics of the other party. Courts generally disapprove of such delays and can impose costs on the party causing the delay or proceed with the case even in their absence if the delay is unreasonable.", "legal_terms": ["Delaying Tactics", "Expedite Hearing", "Costs", "Adjournment"]}
{"question": "What is the 'parol evidence rule'?", "answer": "The parol evidence rule is a legal principle that prevents parties to a written contract from presenting 'extrinsic' evidence (like oral statements or prior emails) to contradict, modify, or vary the terms of the written contract. The rule presumes that the written contract contains the entire agreement between the parties.", "legal_terms": ["Parol Evidence Rule", "Written Contract", "Extrinsic Evidence", "Contract Interpretation"]}
{"question": "I received goods that were substandard, not what I was promised. What's the difference between 'substandard' and 'defective'?", "answer": "'Defective' usually means something is broken or has a specific flaw. 'Substandard' means the product does not meet the quality, grade, or standard that was agreed upon, even if it is not broken. Both are valid grounds for a legal complaint, as the seller has failed to supply the goods as per the contract.", "legal_terms": ["Substandard Goods", "Defective Goods", "Breach of Contract", "Quality"]}
{"question": "A seller's employee, who is no longer with the company, is willing to testify in my favor about defective goods. Is his testimony valid?", "answer": "Yes, his testimony is valid and can be very helpful. As a former employee, he may have inside knowledge of the company's practices. The seller might try to discredit him, but his testimony will be considered by the court along with all other evidence.", "legal_terms": ["Witness", "Testimony", "Evidence", "Former Employee"]}
{"question": "If a cheque is dishonored, how much time do I have to send a legal notice?", "answer": "You must send a legal notice to the drawer of the cheque within 30 days of receiving the information of dishonor from your bank. This is a strict deadline under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Time Limit", "Section 138", "Dishonour of Cheque"]}
{"question": "The seller is defending a defective goods claim by saying 'no loss was caused' because I resold the items. Is this a valid defense?", "answer": "It depends. If you resold the defective items for the same or a higher price, then you may not have suffered a financial loss, and your claim for damages might fail. However, if you had to sell them at a discount, you can claim the difference. The burden is on you to prove the loss you incurred.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Proof of Loss", "Resale", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "What is 'vicarious liability' in a cheque bounce case against a company?", "answer": "Vicarious liability means that the persons in charge of the company (like the Managing Director and other directors) are held criminally liable for the offense committed by the company (the bounced cheque). Section 141 of the NI Act makes these individuals vicariously liable along with the company.", "legal_terms": ["Vicarious Liability", "Section 141 NI Act", "Company Offence", "Director's Liability"]}
{"question": "The seller's invoice has a clause for '2% interest per month'. Is this enforceable?", "answer": "An interest rate of 2% per month (which is 24% per annum) is very high. While it may be mentioned on the invoice, a court is likely to find it 'penal' and unreasonable, especially if it's not in a signed contract. The court can use its discretion to award a much lower and more reasonable rate of interest.", "legal_terms": ["Penal Interest", "Unconscionable Term", "Interest Rate", "Contract Act"]}
{"question": "Can I file a police complaint (FIR) for a simple case of defective goods?", "answer": "Generally, no. A dispute over defective goods is a civil matter, a breach of contract. A police complaint or FIR is for criminal offenses. You could only file an FIR if there was an element of cheating or fraud from the very beginning (e.g., the seller never intended to supply the correct goods). For a simple defect, the proper remedy is a consumer complaint or civil suit.", "legal_terms": ["Civil Dispute", "Criminal Offense", "FIR", "Cheating"]}
{"question": "The seller wants to settle our dispute, but I have already spent a lot on legal fees. Can I ask them to pay for my costs?", "answer": "Yes. When negotiating a settlement, you can and should include your legal costs as part of the total settlement amount. A comprehensive settlement should cover not just the principal claim but also the reasonable costs you have incurred to pursue it.", "legal_terms": ["Settlement", "Legal Costs", "Negotiation", "Full and Final Settlement"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by the original seller, but I bought the goods through their authorized dealer. Is this correct?", "answer": "This is unusual. Your contract is with the authorized dealer from whom you purchased the goods. The legal principle of 'privity of contract' means you should sue and be sued by the dealer. The original seller (manufacturer) can only sue the dealer, and the dealer can sue you. A direct suit from the manufacturer to you is generally not maintainable unless there are special circumstances.", "legal_terms": ["Privity of Contract", "Dealer", "Manufacturer", "Parties to a Suit"]}
{"question": "I have filed an appeal against a court order. Does this automatically stop the execution of the original order?", "answer": "No, filing an appeal does not automatically stop the execution of the original order. You need to file a separate application in the appellate court for a 'stay' on the execution of the lower court's decree. The appellate court may grant a stay, sometimes on the condition that you deposit a part of the decreed amount in the court.", "legal_terms": ["Stay Order", "Appeal", "Execution", "Conditional Stay"]}
{"question": "What is the role of a 'mediator' in resolving a consumer dispute?", "answer": "A mediator is a neutral third person who helps the two parties (consumer and seller) to communicate and reach a mutually agreeable settlement. Mediation is a voluntary process, and the mediator does not impose a decision. If a settlement is reached, it is written down and becomes a legally binding agreement.", "legal_terms": ["Mediation", "Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)", "Settlement", "Mediator"]}
{"question": "The seller is trying to introduce new documents in court at the very end of the trial. Is this allowed?", "answer": "This is generally not allowed. Parties are expected to file all their documents at the beginning of the trial. Introducing new evidence at a late stage can be permitted by the court only if the party can show a very strong reason why they could not produce it earlier despite due diligence. The other party would have the right to object.", "legal_terms": ["Late Filing", "Evidence", "Due Diligence", "Civil Procedure Code"]}
{"question": "Can I claim a refund for a service that was defective or deficient?", "answer": "Yes, absolutely. The Consumer Protection Act covers both goods and services. If a service you paid for (like a repair, an insurance policy, or a travel package) is deficient in any way, you have the same rights to claim a refund, compensation, or re-performance of the service as you would for defective goods.", "legal_terms": ["Deficiency in Service", "Consumer Protection Act", "Services", "Refund"]}
{"question": "What is a 'pro-forma invoice' and is it a legal bill?", "answer": "A pro-forma invoice is a preliminary bill or an estimated invoice sent to the buyer in advance of a shipment or delivery of goods. It is not a true invoice and does not create a formal demand for payment. The final legal bill is the 'tax invoice' or 'commercial invoice' issued after the goods are dispatched.", "legal_terms": ["Pro-forma Invoice", "Tax Invoice", "Commercial Invoice"]}
{"question": "The seller has gone into insolvency. Can I still recover my money for the defective goods?", "answer": "Once a company enters insolvency proceedings, a moratorium is typically declared, which means no legal action can be taken or continued against it. You will have to file your claim with the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) or Liquidator. However, consumer claims are often treated as unsecured debt, and the chances of full recovery can be low.", "legal_terms": ["Insolvency", "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)", "Moratorium", "Unsecured Creditor"]}
{"question": "The court judgment mentions 'MO-1 to MO-9'. What does this mean?", "answer": "'MO' stands for 'Material Object'. These are physical items produced in court as evidence. For example, in a defective goods case, the actual defective products (like the rusted sprinklers or cracked tiles) can be marked as MO-1, MO-2, etc., for the judge to physically inspect.", "legal_terms": ["Material Object (MO)", "Evidence", "Exhibit"]}
{"question": "Can my conduct as a buyer affect my defective goods claim?", "answer": "Yes, your conduct is very important. If you issue a fresh cheque after knowing about a defect, or if you delay complaining for a very long time, or if you don't reply to a legal notice, the court might see your conduct as inconsistent with that of a genuinely aggrieved person. This can weaken your defense or claim.", "legal_terms": ["Conduct of Parties", "Estoppel by Conduct", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "The seller is a 'sole proprietor'. Is the business a separate legal entity from the owner?", "answer": "No. In a sole proprietorship, the business and the owner are legally considered one and the same. The owner is personally liable for all the debts and obligations of the business. There is no legal distinction or 'corporate veil' as there is with a company.", "legal_terms": ["Sole Proprietorship", "Unlimited Liability", "Separate Legal Entity"]}
{"question": "I have been asked to pay court fees to file a case against a seller. Is this normal?", "answer": "Yes, for filing a civil suit for recovery of money, you have to pay a court fee, which is usually a percentage of the amount you are claiming. However, for filing a complaint in a Consumer Commission, the fee is much lower and is a fixed amount based on the value of your claim.", "legal_terms": ["Court Fees", "Civil Suit", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "The seller's witness did not appear for cross-examination. What is the effect of his testimony?", "answer": "If a witness gives their testimony (examination-in-chief) but does not make themselves available for cross-examination, their testimony is considered incomplete and has no evidentiary value. The court will likely disregard their affidavit or statement entirely.", "legal_terms": ["Cross-examination", "Evidence Act", "Incomplete Evidence", "Witness Testimony"]}
{"question": "Can I claim damages if a defective product caused me to lose a contract with my client?", "answer": "This would be a claim for 'consequential loss' or 'loss of profit'. To succeed, you must prove that your supplier knew about your contract with the client and understood that their defective product would cause you to lose that specific contract. Without this 'contemplation of parties', such claims are generally considered too 'remote' and are difficult to win.", "legal_terms": ["Consequential Loss", "Loss of Profit", "Remoteness of Damage", "Contract Act"]}
{"question": "What is the 'last payment' rule for the limitation period in a running account?", "answer": "In a running account, the three-year limitation period to file a suit for recovery of the outstanding balance does not start from the date of each invoice. Instead, it is refreshed and starts from the date of the last payment made by the buyer. This payment acts as an acknowledgment of the entire outstanding debt at that time.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Running Account", "Part-Payment", "Acknowledgment of Debt"]}
{"question": "A product I bought online was delivered by a third-party courier. If it was damaged in transit, who is responsible: the seller or the courier?", "answer": "This depends on the shipping terms. If it was an 'FOB' or 'ex-works' contract, the risk passes to you once the seller hands it over to the courier. In that case, you would have to claim from the courier's insurance. If it was a 'door delivery' contract, the seller is responsible until it reaches you, and you should claim from the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Risk in Transit", "FOB Contract", "Courier Liability", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "Can I settle a cheque bounce case 'out of court'?", "answer": "Yes. You and the complainant can settle the matter privately between yourselves. Once you have paid the agreed settlement amount, you should jointly file an application or a statement in the court informing the judge about the settlement. The court will then dispose of the case as 'compounded' or 'settled'.", "legal_terms": ["Out-of-Court Settlement", "Compounding of Offence", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "Is it better to file a consumer complaint or a civil suit for a defective product?", "answer": "A consumer complaint is generally faster, cheaper, and simpler. The procedure is less formal than a civil court. A civil suit is more complex and expensive but may be necessary for very high-value or complicated commercial disputes. For most individuals and small businesses, the consumer court is the preferred option.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer Complaint", "Civil Suit", "Choice of Forum", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "I paid a seller in cash for goods that were defective. How can I prove the payment?", "answer": "Proving a cash payment is difficult without a receipt. If the seller denies receiving the cash, the burden is on you to prove it. You could rely on witness testimony (if someone saw the payment), entries in your own account books, or any indirect evidence. This is why it is always safer to pay via banking channels.", "legal_tems": ["Cash Payment", "Proof of Payment", "Evidence", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "A product caused a fire in my house. Can I sue the manufacturer for this?", "answer": "Yes. This is a classic 'product liability' case. You can sue the manufacturer for supplying a defective product that was unsafe and caused damage to your property. You can claim compensation for all the damages, including the cost of repairs to your house, under the Consumer Protection Act.", "legal_terms": ["Product Liability", "Consumer Protection Act", "Unsafe Goods", "Damages"]}
{"question": "What is a 'statutory notice'?", "answer": "A 'statutory notice' is a legal notice that is required by a specific law (a statute) as a pre-condition to filing a case. For example, the legal notice sent within 30 days of a cheque bounce is a statutory notice under Section 138 of the NI Act. Sending this notice is mandatory.", "legal_terms": ["Statutory Notice", "Legal Notice", "Mandatory Requirement"]}
{"question": "The seller is a big company and is threatening me with a defamation suit for posting negative reviews online about their defective product. Can they do this?", "answer": "They can threaten, but they are unlikely to succeed if your reviews are truthful and based on your actual experience. Truth is a strong defense against defamation. You have the right to free speech and to share your genuine feedback as a consumer. However, ensure your reviews are factual and not abusive.", "legal_terms": ["Defamation", "Freedom of Speech", "Truth as a Defense", "Online Review"]}
{"question": "Can a company that has been dissolved still be sued?", "answer": "No. Once a company is formally dissolved and its name is struck off the Register of Companies, it ceases to exist as a legal entity. It can no longer sue or be sued. Any pending legal cases against it would also abate (come to an end).", "legal_terms": ["Dissolution of Company", "Struck Off", "Abatement of Suit"]}
{"question": "The seller is asking me to sign a document saying I have received the goods in 'good condition' before they will even unload them. Should I sign it?", "answer": "You should be very careful. If you sign it, it can be used against you later if you discover a defect. You can insist on writing 'Received, subject to inspection' or 'Packaging intact, contents not checked' next to your signature. This protects your right to inspect the goods later.", "legal_terms": ["Delivery Receipt", "Subject to Inspection", "Waiver of Rights", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I have an audio recording of a seller admitting the product is faulty. Can I use this in court?", "answer": "Yes, an audio recording can be submitted as electronic evidence. However, its admissibility can be complex. You may need to provide a transcript, a certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act, and potentially prove that the recording has not been tampered with. The other party may also raise issues of privacy.", "legal_terms": ["Audio Recording", "Electronic Evidence", "Admissibility", "Section 65B Certificate"]}
{"question": "I won my case in the District Consumer Forum. The seller has appealed to the State Commission. Do I need a new lawyer?", "answer": "While your trial court lawyer can often handle the appeal, the State Commission is a higher forum with different procedures. It is advisable to either retain your lawyer if they have appellate experience or engage a lawyer who specializes in practicing before the State Commission to effectively represent your case.", "legal_terms": ["Appeal", "State Commission", "Appellate Practice", "Legal Representation"]}
{"question": "The seller's website has a 'terms and conditions' link that I never clicked. Am I still bound by it?", "answer": "This is a 'browse-wrap' agreement. Courts have held that if the terms and conditions are clearly visible and a reasonable user would have known about them, you can be bound by them even if you didn't click or read them. The key is whether you were given a reasonable notice of their existence.", "legal_terms": ["Browse-wrap Agreement", "Terms and Conditions", "Implied Consent", "Online Contract"]}
{"question": "A seller sold me a fake product, claiming it was original. What legal action can I take?", "answer": "This is a case of both cheating and selling counterfeit goods. You can file a consumer complaint for an unfair trade practice and deficiency. You can also file a criminal complaint (FIR) with the police for cheating (Section 420 of IPC) and for trademark infringement under the Trade Marks Act.", "legal_terms": ["Counterfeit Goods", "Cheating (IPC 420)", "Unfair Trade Practice", "Trademark Infringement"]}
{"question": "What is the highest consumer court in India?", "answer": "The highest consumer court in India is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), located in New Delhi. It hears appeals from the State Commissions and also has direct jurisdiction over cases where the value of goods or services exceeds ten crore rupees.", "legal_terms": ["National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)", "Appellate Jurisdiction", "Pecuniary Jurisdiction"]}
{"question": "Can I claim a refund for a product that is defective, even if it is still usable to some extent?", "answer": "Yes. A product does not have to be completely unusable to be considered defective. If it has a fault or imperfection that prevents it from being used for its normal purpose or diminishes its value, you can still claim a remedy. The remedy might be a partial refund or repair, depending on the nature of the defect.", "legal_terms": ["Defect", "Merchantable Quality", "Partial Refund", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "A seller is refusing to honor the warranty, saying it was only for the 'first purchaser'. I bought the item as a gift for someone. Who can claim the warranty?", "answer": "Typically, the warranty is for the 'first purchaser', which is you. The person you gifted it to may not have a direct claim against the seller due to 'privity of contract'. You, as the original buyer, would have to make the warranty claim on their behalf.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "First Purchaser", "Privity of Contract", "Gift"]}
{"question": "What does 'pendente lite' interest mean?", "answer": "'Pendente lite' is a Latin term that means 'while the litigation is pending'. Pendente lite interest is the interest awarded by a court on the claimed amount for the period from the date the case was filed until the date the judgment is delivered.", "legal_terms": ["Pendente Lite", "Interest", "Civil Procedure Code"]}
{"question": "The seller is a foreign company with no office in India. How can I sue them for a defective product bought online?", "answer": "Suing a foreign company with no presence in India is extremely difficult. Enforcing an Indian court's order against them would be a major challenge. It is always safer to buy from sellers who have a registered entity or office in India, against whom you can easily seek legal recourse.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Foreign Company", "Enforcement of Judgment"]}
{"question": "My new car has a major engine defect. The company is only offering to repair it. Can I demand a full replacement?", "answer": "Yes, you can demand a replacement. For a major manufacturing defect in a new vehicle that affects its fundamental functioning and safety, you have a strong case in the consumer court to ask for a complete replacement of the vehicle, not just repairs. Several judgments have been passed in favor of consumers for such cases.", "legal_terms": ["Manufacturing Defect", "Replacement", "Consumer Complaint", "Implied Warranty"]}
{"question": "What is a 'material alteration' of a cheque?", "answer": "A 'material alteration' is any change to a cheque (like changing the amount or the payee's name) without the consent of the person who drew it. A materially altered cheque becomes void. However, filling in a blank cheque is not considered a material alteration, as the drawer is deemed to have given authority to the holder to fill it.", "legal_terms": ["Material Alteration", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Void Instrument", "Blank Cheque"]}
{"question": "I filed a consumer complaint, and the seller did not show up. What will happen?", "answer": "If the seller does not appear in the Consumer Commission despite proper service of notice, the Commission can proceed 'ex-parte'. This means it will hear your side of the case and pass a judgment based on your evidence alone. The seller loses their right to defend the case.", "legal_terms": ["Ex-Parte", "Consumer Commission", "Service of Notice"]}
{"question": "The seller's technician visited and confirmed the defect in a report, but the company is still not giving me a refund. What should I do?", "answer": "The technician's report is a crucial piece of evidence and an admission of the defect by the company's own representative. You should immediately file a consumer complaint and submit this report as evidence. It makes your case very strong.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Admission", "Technician Report", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "I bought an extended warranty for my appliance. Is it as good as the original manufacturer's warranty?", "answer": "You need to read the terms carefully. An extended warranty is often provided by a third-party company, not the manufacturer. Its terms, coverage, and service quality might be different and sometimes more restrictive than the original manufacturer's warranty. It is a separate contract.", "legal_terms": ["Extended Warranty", "Warranty", "Third-Party Contract"]}
{"question": "A seller is claiming that since I am a Chartered Accountant, I should have known better than to accept defective goods. Is this a valid argument?", "answer": "No, this is not a valid legal argument. Your profession does not take away your rights as a consumer or a buyer. The seller has an obligation to supply goods of a certain quality, regardless of the buyer's profession. Your rights under the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act remain the same.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer Rights", "Caveat Emptor", "Professional Status"]}
{"question": "Can I claim travel and communication costs I incurred while pursuing a complaint for a defective product?", "answer": "Yes. When you file a consumer complaint, you can include a claim for litigation costs. This can cover reasonable expenses you incurred, such as travel for hearings, communication costs, and legal fees. The Commission has the discretion to award these costs if it finds your complaint to be genuine.", "legal_terms": ["Litigation Costs", "Compensation", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between 'rejection' of goods and claiming 'damages'?", "answer": "'Rejection' is when you refuse to accept the goods altogether because of a major defect or breach of condition, and you can demand a full refund. Claiming 'damages' is when you keep the goods but sue the seller for monetary compensation to cover the loss in value due to a minor defect or breach of warranty.", "legal_terms": ["Rejection of Goods", "Damages", "Breach of Condition", "Breach of Warranty"]}
{"question": "The MRP on the product was ₹1000, but the seller billed me ₹1200. Is this legal?", "answer": "No, it is illegal for a seller to charge more than the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) printed on the product packaging. This is a violation of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules and constitutes an unfair trade practice. You can file a complaint against the seller in the consumer court.", "legal_terms": ["Maximum Retail Price (MRP)", "Unfair Trade Practice", "Legal Metrology"]}
{"question": "My case has been going on for years, and the seller is now offering a settlement. Should I accept it?", "answer": "This is a practical decision for you to make. You should weigh the settlement amount offered against the best possible outcome if you win the case, the time and cost of continuing the litigation, and the uncertainty of the final verdict. It is often wise to consider a reasonable settlement to achieve a certain and faster resolution.", "legal_terms": ["Settlement", "Litigation", "Risk Assessment"]}
{"question": "The seller has gone out of business. Can I sue the owner personally for the defective product he sold me?", "answer": "If the business was a 'sole proprietorship' or a 'partnership', then yes, you can sue the owner(s) personally as they have unlimited liability. However, if the business was a 'private limited company', you generally cannot sue the owner (shareholder) or director personally, as the company is a separate legal entity.", "legal_terms": ["Sole Proprietorship", "Partnership", "Private Limited Company", "Unlimited Liability", "Limited Liability"]}
{"question": "I received a judgment in my favor from the consumer court. How long does the seller have to comply with it?", "answer": "The Consumer Commission's order will usually specify a time period for compliance, typically 30 or 45 days. If the seller fails to comply within this period, you can file an execution petition to enforce the order. Failure to comply can also lead to penalties, including imprisonment, for the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Compliance", "Execution Petition", "Consumer Commission", "Penalty"]}
{"question": "Is there a government helpline I can call for guidance on a defective product issue?", "answer": "Yes, the Department of Consumer Affairs runs the National Consumer Helpline (NCH). You can call their toll-free number (1915) for guidance, information, and to register a preliminary grievance. They can advise you on the steps to take and can also attempt to mediate with the company on your behalf.", "legal_terms": ["National Consumer Helpline (NCH)", "Consumer Affairs", "Grievance Redressal"]}
{"question": "What does it mean for a cheque to be dishonored for 'exceeds arrangement'?", "answer": "'Exceeds arrangement' is a reason for cheque dishonor that means the amount of the cheque is more than the overdraft facility or credit limit arranged by the account holder with the bank. Legally, it is treated similarly to 'insufficient funds' for the purpose of a Section 138 NI Act case.", "legal_terms": ["Exceeds Arrangement", "Dishonour of Cheque", "Section 138", "Overdraft"]}
{"question": "Can I claim a refund for a defective product if I have lost the original bill?", "answer": "Losing the original bill makes your case much more difficult, as it is the primary proof of purchase. However, you can still try to prove the purchase through other means, such as a credit card statement, a bank statement showing the debit, or warranty registration details. Without any proof, a claim is very hard to sustain.", "legal_terms": ["Proof of Purchase", "Invoice", "Evidence", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by a company, but I believe their claim is completely false and just to harass me. What is this called?", "answer": "This is known as 'vexatious' or 'malicious' litigation. If you can prove to the court that the case was filed without any real basis and with the malicious intent to harass you, you can ask the court to dismiss the case and you may even be able to file a separate suit against them for damages for malicious prosecution.", "legal_terms": ["Vexatious Litigation", "Malicious Prosecution", "Abuse of Process"]}
{"question": "The seller is a dealer. The defective product is from a well-known brand. Should I complain to the brand or the dealer?", "answer": "You should complain to both. Your legal contract is with the dealer you bought it from, so they are your first point of contact and are legally responsible to you. However, complaining to the brand (manufacturer) as well puts additional pressure and they may intervene to protect their brand reputation and resolve the issue.", "legal_terms": ["Dealer", "Manufacturer", "Complaint", "Brand Reputation"]}
{"question": "Can an online seller refuse a return by saying their policy is 'no returns'?", "answer": "A 'no returns' policy cannot override your statutory rights. If the product is defective, doesn't match its description, or is not of merchantable quality, you have a legal right to a remedy under the Sale of Goods Act and the Consumer Protection Act, regardless of the seller's stated policy. Such a policy may be considered an 'unfair contract term'.", "legal_terms": ["Return Policy", "Unfair Contract Term", "Statutory Rights", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My cheque bounce case was dismissed. Can the other party file an appeal?", "answer": "Yes. If you are acquitted (found not guilty) in a cheque bounce case, the complainant has the right to file an appeal against the acquittal in the High Court. The case is not necessarily over with the trial court's judgment.", "legal_terms": ["Appeal against Acquittal", "High Court", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "A product I bought has a minor, cosmetic defect like a scratch. Can I demand a full replacement?", "answer": "For a minor, cosmetic defect that does not affect the product's functionality, a demand for a full replacement might be seen as unreasonable. The seller may offer a small discount, or a repair if possible. A consumer court would likely award a remedy that is proportionate to the defect. A full replacement is usually reserved for major functional defects.", "legal_terms": ["Minor Defect", "Cosmetic Defect", "Proportionate Remedy", "Replacement"]}
{"question": "I am in a dispute and the other party wants to go for 'arbitration'. What is it?", "answer": "Arbitration is a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) where you and the other party agree to have your dispute decided by a neutral third person (the 'arbitrator') instead of going to a regular court. The arbitrator's decision, called an 'award', is legally binding. It is often faster but can be more expensive than consumer court.", "legal_terms": ["Arbitration", "Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)", "Arbitrator", "Arbitral Award"]}
{"question": "The seller is saying that since I got a discount on the product, I can't complain about defects. Is this true?", "answer": "No, this is not true. Selling a product at a discount does not absolve the seller of their responsibility to provide a product that is of merchantable quality and fit for its purpose, unless they specifically sold it as 'defective' or 'seconds' and you were aware of this at the time of purchase. A discount on a standard product does not waive your consumer rights.", "legal_terms": ["Discount", "Defective Goods", "Consumer Rights", "As Is"]}
{"question": "My new phone's battery drains very quickly. Is this a 'defect' I can complain about?", "answer": "Yes, if the battery performance is significantly worse than what is advertised or reasonably expected from a new phone, it can be considered a defect. You can complain that the product is not 'fit for purpose' or does not meet the promised specifications. You should gather evidence, like screenshots of battery usage, to support your claim.", "legal_terms": ["Defect", "Fitness for Purpose", "Performance", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "Can I file a single consumer complaint for multiple defective items bought from the same seller?", "answer": "Yes. If the transactions are related and form part of a series of similar events, you can file a single complaint for multiple defective items from the same seller. This is more efficient than filing separate cases for each item. You should list all the items and their defects clearly in your complaint.", "legal_terms": ["Joinder of Causes of Action", "Consumer Complaint", "Multiple Defects"]}
{"question": "What is the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Consumer Commission?", "answer": "Under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has the jurisdiction to hear complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed fifty lakh rupees.", "legal_terms": ["Pecuniary Jurisdiction", "District Commission", "Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "I'm being sued for non-payment. Can I argue that the contract should be cancelled because the seller cheated me?", "answer": "Yes. If you can prove that the seller made fraudulent misrepresentations to induce you to enter the contract, you can ask the court to rescind (cancel) the contract. Fraud makes a contract 'voidable' at the option of the party who was defrauded. You would not be liable to pay if the contract is rescinded.", "legal_terms": ["Fraud", "Misrepresentation", "Rescission of Contract", "Voidable Contract"]}
{"question": "A seller is claiming that a third-party inspection report is final and binding on me. Is this right?", "answer": "It depends on your contract. If you agreed in your contract that a specific third-party inspection would be final and binding, then you may be bound by it. However, if there was no such agreement, or if the inspection did not cover latent defects, you can still challenge the findings and present your own evidence of the defects.", "legal_terms": ["Third-Party Inspection", "Final and Binding", "Contract Clause", "Latent Defect"]}
{"question": "What is the time limit to file an appeal in the High Court against a civil suit judgment?", "answer": "The time limit to file a Regular First Appeal (RFA) in the High Court against the judgment and decree of a District Court is generally 90 days from the date of the decree.", "legal_terms": ["Regular First Appeal (RFA)", "Limitation Period", "High Court", "Decree"]}
{"question": "My cheque was dishonored. The seller sent me a notice, but my company's name was spelled wrong. Is the notice invalid?", "answer": "A minor spelling mistake in the company name on a legal notice may not make it invalid, as long as the notice was delivered to the correct entity at the correct address and you clearly understood it was meant for you. Courts generally overlook minor clerical errors that do not cause any prejudice.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Clerical Error", "Misnomer", "Service of Notice"]}
{"question": "If I am acquitted in a cheque bounce case, can I sue the complainant for filing a false case?", "answer": "Yes, you can. After being acquitted, you can file a civil suit for 'malicious prosecution' against the complainant. To succeed, you will have to prove that the case was filed by them without any reasonable cause and with a malicious intent, and that the proceedings terminated in your favor.", "legal_terms": ["Malicious Prosecution", "Damages", "Acquittal", "False Case"]}
{"question": "The seller is in another country. Can I file a consumer complaint against their Indian subsidiary or dealer?", "answer": "Yes. It is much more effective to file a complaint against the Indian subsidiary, dealer, or importer. The Indian entity is the one that has placed the product on the Indian market and is responsible to Indian consumers under Indian law. Suing the foreign parent company directly is often impractical.", "legal_terms": ["Subsidiary", "Importer", "Jurisdiction", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "Can a seller refuse to give me a copy of my invoice?", "answer": "No. As a buyer, you are entitled to an invoice or bill for your purchase. It is proof of your transaction. A seller's refusal to provide an invoice is an unfair and illegal practice. You can complain about this to consumer forums and tax authorities.", "legal_terms": ["Invoice", "Proof of Purchase", "Unfair Trade Practice"]}
{"question": "I bought a product 'as is' and it turned out to be defective. What are my rights?", "answer": "When you buy a product 'as is', the seller is disclaiming all implied warranties. This means you accept the product in its current condition with all its faults. Your rights to complain about defects are severely limited, unless the seller actively concealed a major defect or made a fraudulent misrepresentation about the product's condition.", "legal_terms": ["As Is", "Disclaimer of Warranty", "Implied Warranty", "Caveat Emptor"]}
{"question": "The seller made a mistake in the invoice, charging me less than the agreed price. Can they demand the extra amount later?", "answer": "Yes, they can. A clerical error in an invoice does not prevent the seller from claiming the correct, agreed-upon price. They can issue a debit note or a revised invoice for the difference. Similarly, if they overcharge you, you have the right to claim a refund for the excess amount.", "legal_terms": ["Clerical Error", "Invoice", "Debit Note", "Contract Price"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between 'damage' and 'damages' in law?", "answer": "'Damage' refers to the actual harm or loss suffered (e.g., the broken product, the financial loss). 'Damages' refers to the monetary compensation awarded by a court to the injured party to make up for the damage they suffered.", "legal_terms": ["Damage", "Damages", "Compensation", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "My new furniture has a termite infestation. Is the seller liable?", "answer": "Yes, the seller is liable. Supplying furniture with a termite infestation is a clear case of providing a defective product. Termites are a latent defect that you could not have been expected to discover at the time of purchase. You can demand a replacement or a full refund.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Defective Goods", "Furniture", "Implied Warranty"]}
{"question": "The seller's website showed a picture of the product. The one I received looks different. Can I return it?", "answer": "Yes. This is a case of 'sale by description' and 'sale by sample'. The product delivered must correspond to the description and the picture shown. If it is materially different, you have the right to reject it and claim a refund, as the seller has breached a condition of the sale.", "legal_terms": ["Sale by Description", "Sale by Sample", "Breach of Condition", "Right to Reject"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by a company that does not exist anymore. What should I do?", "answer": "If the company has been officially dissolved or struck off, it no longer has the legal capacity to continue a lawsuit. You should bring this fact to the notice of the court by providing official records from the Registrar of Companies. The court will then likely dismiss the suit as having 'abated'.", "legal_terms": ["Dissolved Company", "Abatement of Suit", "Locus Standi"]}
{"question": "I agreed to a settlement in court. Can I back out of it later?", "answer": "Generally, no. A settlement agreed to before a court or a mediator and recorded in a court order is a binding agreement. You cannot unilaterally back out of it. If you fail to comply with the settlement terms, the other party can have it enforced through the court.", "legal_terms": ["Settlement Agreement", "Consent Decree", "Binding Contract", "Enforceability"]}
{"question": "What is the main purpose of the Consumer Protection Act?", "answer": "The main purpose of the Consumer Protection Act is to provide a simpler, faster, and more effective mechanism for the protection of consumer rights and the redressal of consumer grievances. It aims to protect consumers from unfair trade practices, defective goods, and deficient services.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer Protection Act", "Consumer Rights", "Grievance Redressal", "Unfair Trade Practice"]}
{"question": "What can a buyer do if the seller ignores a complaint?", "answer": "They can file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "What should I do if a company sells me a defective product?", "answer": "Case Summary:\n\nYou have purchased a product that turned out to be defective, and you are seeking guidance on how to resolve the issue.\n\nCase Type:\n\nConsumer Law, Defective Goods\n\nLegal Provisions:\n\nThe Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides a strong framework to protect your rights. Key provisions include:\n\n- **Section 2(10) - \"Defect\":** This defines a defect as any fault, imperfection, or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, potency, purity, or standard of a product.\n- **Section 2(47) - \"Unfair Trade Practice\":** Supplying defective goods is considered an unfair trade practice, and you have the right to seek redressal against it.\n- **Section 2(9) - Consumer Rights:** This includes the right to be protected against the marketing of goods which are hazardous to life and property and the right to be informed about the quality and purity of the goods.\n\nLegal Remedies:\n\nTo address the issue of receiving a defective product, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Contact the Seller/Manufacturer:** Your first step should be to contact the seller or the manufacturer. Explain the defect clearly, provide proof of purchase (invoice/bill), and request a replacement, repair, or a full refund as per the warranty terms.\n\n2.  **Send a Written Complaint/Email:** If verbal communication doesn't work, send a formal written complaint via email or registered post. Clearly state the problem, the resolution you expect, and a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 15 days) for them to respond.\n\n3.  **Send a Legal Notice:** If you do not receive a satisfactory response, you can have a lawyer send a formal legal notice. This often prompts companies to resolve the issue to avoid litigation.\n\n4.  **File a Complaint in Consumer Court:** If the seller still fails to provide a remedy, you can file a complaint with the appropriate Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. You can do this yourself or through a lawyer. Complaints can now be filed electronically through the E-Daakhil portal.\n\nPractical Advice:\n\n- **Preserve Evidence:** Keep the defective product in its original condition as much as possible. Take clear photos and videos of the defect. Keep all receipts, invoices, warranty cards, and communication records with the seller.\n- **Document Everything:** Maintain a log of all your interactions, including dates, times, names of people you spoke to, and what was discussed.\n- **Check Warranty Terms:** Review the warranty card to understand your rights regarding repair, replacement, or refund.\n\nActing promptly and documenting every step is crucial for building a strong case. The law ensures that you are not left with a faulty product and are entitled to a fair resolution.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Consumer Protection Act, 2019", "Unfair Trade Practice", "Warranty", "Legal Notice", "Consumer Court"]}
{"question": "I bought a product from a company in another state online. Where can I file a consumer complaint if it's defective?", "answer": "You can file a complaint in the Consumer Commission located where you live or work. Under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, jurisdiction is consumer-friendly. The place where the seller is located does not prevent you from filing a case in your own city, as part of the transaction (like payment or delivery) happened there.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Consumer Protection Act, 2019", "Cause of Action"]}
{"question": "I paid for goods with a cheque, but they were defective. Can I just tell my bank to stop the payment?", "answer": "Yes, you can instruct your bank to stop payment on a cheque if the goods are defective. However, the seller can still file a case against you under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. You will then have to prove in court that the goods were genuinely defective and that you had a valid reason to stop the payment. You must have strong evidence of the defects.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Section 138", "Defective Goods", "Stop Payment"]}
{"question": "The seller is refusing to accept my return, saying I should have checked the item at delivery. What are my rights?", "answer": "Under the Sale of Goods Act, a buyer has the right to a reasonable opportunity to examine goods to see if they conform to the contract. While it is good practice to inspect items on delivery, you are not always required to do so on the spot, especially for latent defects that are not immediately obvious. If a defect is discovered later, you can still claim your rights under the warranty or the Consumer Protection Act.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Right to Examine", "Latent Defect", "Warranty"]}
{"question": "What kind of proof do I need to show that a product I received is defective?", "answer": "To prove a product is defective, you need solid evidence. This can include photos and videos of the defect, communication with the seller (emails, letters), reports from an expert or certified technician, and any complaints from other customers if available. Merely stating the product is defective without evidence is often not enough to win a case.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Evidence", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller has taken back defective goods from me before but is now refusing. Does this help my case?", "answer": "Yes, if a seller has a history or habit of accepting returns and issuing credit notes for defective goods, it can support your claim that the current refusal is unfair. This past conduct can be presented as evidence to show an established practice between you and the seller, making your claim for the current defective product stronger.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Course of Dealing", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "The seller's invoice mentions a warranty, but we never signed a separate warranty agreement. Is the invoice warranty valid?", "answer": "Yes, if the warranty terms are printed on the invoice and you have accepted the goods and the invoice without objection, those terms are generally considered part of the sales contract. By accepting the transaction, you implicitly agree to its stated terms, including the warranty conditions.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Invoice", "Terms and Conditions", "Contract"]}
{"question": "Only a few items in my bulk order were defective. Do I still have to pay the seller?", "answer": "You are generally liable to pay for the non-defective goods you received and accepted. For the defective items, you can seek a replacement, repair, or a refund/credit note from the seller. It is crucial to prove which specific goods were defective and their value to justify withholding that portion of the payment.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Partial Defect", "Liability", "Credit Note"]}
{"question": "My cheque to a seller bounced. Can I argue in court that the goods were defective and I didn't owe the money?", "answer": "Yes, claiming that the goods were defective is a valid defense in a cheque bounce case under the Negotiable Instruments Act. However, the burden of proof will be on you to convince the court that the goods were indeed faulty and that this discharged you from the liability to pay. You must provide strong evidence of the defects.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Section 138", "Defective Goods", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller sued me for non-payment, but their goods were faulty and caused me losses. Can I sue them back in the same case?", "answer": "Yes, if a seller sues you for payment, you can file a 'counter-claim' in the same lawsuit for the damages you suffered due to their defective goods. This allows the court to hear both claims together and decide the final amount owed by either party after setting off the claims against each other.", "legal_terms": ["Counter-claim", "Set-off", "Defective Goods", "Damages"]}
{"question": "I've been telling the seller about the defective product on the phone, but they ignore me. Is that enough?", "answer": "While phone calls are a start, they are difficult to prove. It is highly recommended to communicate your complaint in writing, such as through email or a registered letter. A written record is crucial evidence to show that you formally notified the seller about the defect and gave them an opportunity to resolve it. Courts give more weight to written communication.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Written Communication", "Defective Goods", "Complaint"]}
{"question": "The seller claims I accepted the goods because their representative inspected them before shipping. But the goods are defective. What can I do?", "answer": "Even if a pre-shipment inspection was done, you may still have rights, especially if the defects were 'latent' (not discoverable by a normal inspection). If the inspection was limited in scope and couldn't have revealed the internal flaws, you can argue that you did not lose your right to reject the goods or claim damages upon discovering the defects after delivery.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Inspection", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "I gave a seller a signed blank cheque as security for future purchases. Now they have filled an amount and presented it, even though I have issues with the goods. Is this legal?", "answer": "While providing a blank cheque is risky, the law presumes it was issued for a legally enforceable debt. If the seller presents it, the burden is on you to prove it was only for security and that no such debt exists due to defective goods or other issues. If you cannot prove this, you could be held liable under the Negotiable Instruments Act.", "legal_terms": ["Blank Cheque", "Security", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Legally Enforceable Debt", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "What happens if a seller of defective goods doesn't have a registered office in my city?", "answer": "You can still file a suit against the seller in your city if a part of the cause of action, such as placing the order, receiving the goods, or making payment, occurred there. The seller's location is not the only factor for determining jurisdiction.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Civil Procedure Code"]}
{"question": "A product I bought has rusted, but it's meant to be used with water. Is this a defect?", "answer": "Yes, if a product like a sprinkler, which is intended for use with water, rusts quickly, it is considered defective. The product is not of merchantable quality as it fails to meet the basic standard expected for its intended use.", "legal_terms": ["Defect", "Merchantable Quality", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "I bought something from a company that was later sold to another company. Who is responsible for the warranty?", "answer": "When a business is sold, its assets and liabilities, including receivables and warranty obligations, are often transferred to the new owner. The new company (the successor-in-interest) would typically be responsible for honoring the warranty for products sold by the original company.", "legal_terms": ["Successor-in-interest", "Business Transfer Agreement", "Warranty", "Liability"]}
{"question": "How long is a warranty valid if the purchase order just says '14 months' without a start date?", "answer": "Generally, if a warranty period is mentioned, it is interpreted to run from the date of sale from the seller to you (the immediate buyer). It does not usually start from the date you resell it to an end consumer, as the seller has no control or knowledge of that subsequent sale.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty Period", "Date of Sale", "Contract Interpretation"]}
{"question": "Can I claim storage costs for keeping defective goods that the seller won't take back?", "answer": "Claiming storage costs for defective goods is difficult. Such claims are often considered claims for damages rather than warranty claims. To succeed, you must prove there was a breach of contract, a direct loss because of it, and a causal link. Courts may not entertain such claims if not explicitly covered in your agreement.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Breach of Contract", "Warranty Claim"]}
{"question": "The seller sent me an email admitting I owe a certain amount after deducting for some returned goods. Can I use this as proof?", "answer": "Yes, a written communication like an email from the seller confirming a balance due after adjustments for defective returns can be used as a strong piece of evidence. It serves as an admission of liability for the returned goods and helps establish the outstanding amount.", "legal_terms": ["Admission of Liability", "Evidence", "Reconciliation of Accounts"]}
{"question": "A seller is suing me for non-payment, but they haven't provided a statement of account. How does this affect their case?", "answer": "In a suit for recovery of money, the absence of a statement of account or other sufficient documentary evidence makes it very difficult for the seller to prove their claim. Without clear computation and proof, a court may not grant the full amount claimed by the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Statement of Account", "Burden of Proof", "Documentary Evidence"]}
{"question": "My customer is holding back payment because the goods I sold them were defective. Can I claim this loss from my supplier?", "answer": "Yes, you can claim this as a loss. However, you must prove that the goods from your supplier were indeed defective, that you supplied these specific goods to your customer, and that the customer's non-payment is a direct result of the defects. You need to provide invoices and communication to link the entire chain of events.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Defective Goods", "Causation", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "I am being sued, and the other party is using my company's old balance sheet against me. Is that allowed?", "answer": "Yes, balance sheets and other financial documents can be used as evidence in court. If a balance sheet shows an amount due to a creditor (the other party), it can be seen as an admission of debt. You would need to provide strong reasons to dispute that entry.", "legal_terms": ["Balance Sheet", "Evidence", "Admission of Debt", "Sundry Creditors"]}
{"question": "I issued a debit note to my supplier for defective goods, but they claim they never received it. What should I do?", "answer": "Simply issuing a debit note is not enough; you must prove that the supplier received it. Without proof of receipt (like a signed delivery confirmation or an email read-receipt), the supplier can deny it, and the court may not consider the debit note as a valid adjustment against your dues.", "legal_terms": ["Debit Note", "Proof of Receipt", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods in an international 'FOB' contract. Can I still reject them after they arrive in my country?", "answer": "Yes. In an FOB (Free on Board) contract, while the risk passes to you once the goods are on the ship, you retain the right to inspect and reject them upon arrival if they are defective. The FOB term primarily deals with risk during transit, not the fundamental quality of the goods.", "legal_terms": ["FOB Contract", "Sale of Goods Act", "Right to Reject", "Inspection"]}
{"question": "How are damages calculated if I receive defective goods under an FOB contract?", "answer": "Generally, damages are the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods at the port of shipment on the date of breach. However, if the seller knew the goods were for a specific resale market (like the US), the court may consider the market price at that destination for calculating damages.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "FOB Contract", "Market Price", "Breach of Contract"]}
{"question": "The supplier's inspector (SGS) checked the goods before they were shipped, but they still turned out to be defective. Can the supplier deny responsibility?", "answer": "No. A pre-shipment inspection certificate is not always conclusive proof of quality. If the inspection was limited or could not have revealed latent (hidden) defects, the supplier remains liable for breach of warranty. The inspector's certificate does not relieve the seller of their contractual obligation to supply goods of the agreed quality.", "legal_terms": ["Pre-shipment Inspection", "Latent Defect", "Warranty", "SGS Certificate"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods and had to sell them at a lower 'salvage' price. Can I claim the difference from the supplier?", "answer": "Yes. The measure of damages for defective goods is typically the difference between what the goods would have been worth if they were not defective (market value) and the price you actually got for them (salvage value). You can sue the supplier to recover this loss.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Salvage Value", "Market Value", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My supplier failed to deliver a second lot of goods after I complained about the first lot being defective. Can I claim damages for the non-delivery?", "answer": "Yes, if you have a concluded contract for the second lot. The supplier cannot refuse to supply the second lot just because you raised a genuine complaint about the first. Their failure to deliver the second lot would be a separate breach of contract for which you can claim damages.", "legal_terms": ["Breach of Contract", "Non-delivery", "Damages", "Concluded Contract"]}
{"question": "I tried to settle my cheque bounce case by offering to pay, but the other party refused. What happens now?", "answer": "A cheque bounce case under Section 138 of the NI Act can only be compounded (settled) with the consent of both parties. If the complainant does not agree to your settlement offer, the court cannot force them to accept it. The trial will proceed, and the court will decide the case on its merits.", "legal_terms": ["Compounding of Offence", "Section 138", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Settlement"]}
{"question": "The court convicted me in a cheque bounce case. Can the punishment be just a fine instead of jail time?", "answer": "Yes. For an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act, the court can sentence you to a fine, imprisonment, or both. Courts often prioritize compensating the complainant and may impose a fine (up to twice the cheque amount) as the primary punishment, with imprisonment only if the fine is not paid.", "legal_terms": ["Sentence", "Section 138", "Fine", "Compensation"]}
{"question": "A business partner gave me an undated security cheque. He says the goods were defective. Can I fill in the date and deposit it?", "answer": "Yes, you can fill in the date on an undated cheque. The law presumes it was given for a valid debt. If the cheque is dishonored, the issuer has to prove in court that there was no existing liability at that time because the goods were defective. The burden of proof is on him.", "legal_terms": ["Undated Cheque", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Burden of Proof", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "My employee made a note on an invoice that goods were defective. Can this be used as evidence against my company?", "answer": "Yes, a note made by your employee (like a salesman) on an official document like an invoice can be used as evidence. It suggests that your company was aware of the defects at that time. It's an important piece of evidence for the buyer.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Invoice", "Admission", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I didn't file a written complaint about defective goods, but I told the delivery person. Is that sufficient?", "answer": "Telling the delivery person is not sufficient. You must formally communicate the defect to the seller or an authorized representative of the company. A court is unlikely to accept a conversation with a driver or a junior employee as a valid notification of defect. Always communicate in writing.", "legal_terms": ["Notification of Defect", "Complaint", "Evidence", "Written Communication"]}
{"question": "The cheque I gave for a purchase bounced. I had already paid a part of the amount in cash before the cheque was presented. Is the case valid?", "answer": "The case may not be valid. If you make a part-payment after issuing a cheque but before it's presented, the legally enforceable debt is reduced. The payee should endorse the part-payment on the cheque and present it for the balance amount only. Presenting it for the full original amount when a lesser amount is due is not permissible under law.", "legal_terms": ["Part-Payment", "Section 56 NI Act", "Legally Enforceable Debt", "Endorsement"]}
{"question": "The seller is charging interest on delayed payments, but we never signed an agreement for it. Is this allowed?", "answer": "If the tax invoices for the goods clearly state that interest will be charged on delayed payments, and you have been accepting these invoices without protest, the seller can argue that you implicitly agreed to this condition. However, if there is no written contract and you have consistently disputed this, you have a strong case to argue against the levy of interest.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Invoice Terms", "Implied Agreement", "Contract"]}
{"question": "I can't file a complaint about a defective product because the company that sold it has shut down. What can I do?", "answer": "If a company shuts down, it becomes very difficult to seek a remedy. However, if the business was sold to another company, you might be able to claim against the new owner. If the company was liquidated, you would have to file a claim with the official liquidator, but recovery is often unlikely for a consumer.", "legal_terms": ["Liquidation", "Successor-in-interest", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "What is a 'latent defect' and does the seller have to cover it?", "answer": "A 'latent defect' is a hidden flaw that is not discoverable through a reasonable inspection at the time of purchase or delivery. Sellers are generally liable for latent defects because the buyer could not have known about them. Pre-shipment inspections do not excuse the seller from liability for such hidden defects.", "legal_terms": ["Latent Defect", "Warranty", "Inspection", "Sale of Goods Act"]}
{"question": "The seller's ledger shows I owe them money, but my ledger shows a different, lower amount. Which one will the court believe?", "answer": "The court will examine both ledgers and other supporting evidence like invoices, payment receipts, and bank statements. If there are discrepancies, the party that can better substantiate their entries with independent proof will have a stronger case. Neither ledger is automatically accepted as the absolute truth.", "legal_terms": ["Ledger Account", "Evidence", "Reconciliation", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "I received defective goods but threw them away because they were rotting. Can I still claim a refund?", "answer": "It is very difficult to claim a refund if you have destroyed the evidence. The defective goods are the primary proof of your claim. Without them, you cannot prove the defect. It is crucial to preserve the goods, take photos, and if possible, get an expert to examine them before disposal.", "legal_terms": ["Evidence", "Defective Goods", "Burden of Proof", "Spoliation of Evidence"]}
{"question": "I'm a reseller. The manufacturer provided a warranty. Does this warranty extend to my customers?", "answer": "Typically, a manufacturer's warranty is a 'business to business' (B2B) warranty that applies only to you, the direct purchaser. It does not automatically extend to your end customers unless the warranty terms explicitly say so. Your customers would have a claim against you, and you would then have a claim against the manufacturer.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Privity of Contract", "Reseller", "B2B Transaction"]}
{"question": "The contract says the seller can't be held responsible for 'consequential or incidental damages'. What does this mean?", "answer": "This means the seller is limiting their liability to only the direct cost of the defective product (like repair or replacement). They are not responsible for indirect losses you might suffer, such as loss of profit, business disruption, or damage to your reputation, which happened as a 'consequence' of the defect.", "legal_terms": ["Consequential Damages", "Limitation of Liability", "Incidental Damages", "Contract Clause"]}
{"question": "Can I use an email from the seller as evidence in court?", "answer": "Yes, an email can be used as electronic evidence. However, to be properly admitted, it should be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, which certifies the authenticity of the electronic record. Without this certificate, the other party can challenge its admissibility.", "legal_terms": ["Electronic Evidence", "Indian Evidence Act", "Section 65B Certificate", "Admissibility"]}
{"question": "The seller is claiming I owe them money based on old invoices from 5 years ago. Is there a time limit for them to sue me?", "answer": "Yes, there is a time limit. For a suit for recovery of money based on an invoice, the period of limitation is generally three years from the date the payment was due. If they are suing you after three years, the suit may be barred by limitation, unless you have made a part-payment or acknowledged the debt in writing in the last three years.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Period of Limitation", "Recovery of Money"]}
{"question": "I made a part-payment by cheque for a long-pending due. Does this affect the time limit for the seller to sue me?", "answer": "Yes. Making a part-payment towards a debt, especially by cheque, acts as an acknowledgment of the debt and extends the limitation period. A fresh period of three years for the seller to file a suit starts from the date of that payment.", "legal_terms": ["Limitation Act", "Section 19", "Part-Payment", "Acknowledgment of Debt"]}
{"question": "The seller is suing me, but their company isn't even properly represented in court. Can I get the case dismissed?", "answer": "You can raise this as a preliminary objection. A company must be represented by a duly authorized person. However, courts often treat this as a curable defect. The company can rectify the error by submitting a proper board resolution or power of attorney at a later stage, so it may not lead to an immediate dismissal.", "legal_terms": ["Authorization", "Board Resolution", "Power of Attorney", "Curable Defect"]}
{"question": "What is an 'unfair trade practice' regarding defective goods?", "answer": "An 'unfair trade practice' under the Consumer Protection Act includes supplying goods that do not comply with the safety or quality standards prescribed by the law or claimed by the seller. Selling defective, old, or refurbished goods as new also qualifies as an unfair trade practice, for which you can seek relief.", "legal_terms": ["Unfair Trade Practice", "Consumer Protection Act", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I bought a product that was defective and it caused further damage to my property. Can I claim for that additional damage?", "answer": "Yes, you can claim for the additional damage as 'consequential damages'. You need to prove that the defect in the product was the direct cause of the subsequent damage to your property. This goes beyond a simple refund for the product itself.", "legal_terms": ["Consequential Damages", "Product Liability", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "The seller promised a high-quality 'prime' product, but it has many defects. What does 'prime' legally mean?", "answer": "The term 'prime' in a contract implies goods of a high standard, suitable for their intended use, and largely free from defects. If the goods supplied have significant defects like rust, wavy edges, or stains, they do not meet the description of 'prime' material, and this constitutes a breach of contract.", "legal_terms": ["Breach of Contract", "Description of Goods", "Prime Quality"]}
{"question": "Can I be forced to accept a credit note for a defective item instead of a cash refund?", "answer": "Whether you have to accept a credit note depends on the seller's return policy and the terms of your purchase agreement. However, under the Consumer Protection Act, a Consumer Commission can order the seller to provide a full refund in cash if the goods are proven to be defective.", "legal_terms": ["Credit Note", "Refund", "Consumer Protection Act", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "A seller sent a legal notice for a bounced cheque, but I never received it. Are they still able to proceed with the case?", "answer": "The seller must prove that the legal notice was sent to your correct address. If they have a valid postal receipt (like registered post), the law presumes the notice was delivered. The burden would then be on you to prove that the address was wrong or you genuinely did not receive it. Simply denying receipt is not enough if they have proof of dispatch.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Service of Notice", "Negotiable Instruments Act", "Presumption of Service"]}
{"question": "I'm in a dispute over defective goods. My supplier has filed a winding-up petition against my company. What is this?", "answer": "A winding-up petition is a serious legal action where a creditor asks the court to liquidate (close down) a company to pay off its debts. However, it can only be used for undisputed debts. If you have a genuine and substantial dispute, such as the goods being defective, the court will likely dismiss the winding-up petition and direct the creditor to file a regular civil suit instead.", "legal_terms": ["Winding-up Petition", "Companies Act", "Disputed Debt", "Bona Fide Dispute"]}
{"question": "Do I have to mitigate my losses if a supplier gives me defective goods?", "answer": "Yes. The law requires you to take reasonable steps to mitigate (or reduce) your losses. For example, you should try to sell the defective goods at a salvage price if possible. You cannot simply let the losses accumulate and then claim the entire amount from the supplier. Your final claim will be for the loss that remained after your reasonable mitigation efforts.", "legal_terms": ["Mitigation of Loss", "Indian Contract Act", "Damages", "Duty to Mitigate"]}
{"question": "The seller's representative came to my office for a 'reconciliation meeting' about my dues. What is the legal effect of this meeting?", "answer": "A reconciliation meeting is an attempt to settle accounts. Any minutes or statements signed during this meeting can be used as evidence of an agreed-upon outstanding amount. If a net amount payable is determined after accounting for defective goods, it can be considered a binding agreement on the reconciled figure.", "legal_terms": ["Reconciliation of Accounts", "Settlement", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a 'credit note' and a 'debit note' in a defective goods dispute?", "answer": "A 'credit note' is issued by the seller to the buyer, reducing the amount the buyer owes (e.g., as a refund for returned defective goods). A 'debit note' is issued by the buyer to the seller, formally claiming a certain amount from the seller (e.g., for the value of defective goods the buyer is returning or rejecting).", "legal_terms": ["Credit Note", "Debit Note", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "If I am a proprietor of a firm, can the legal case for a bounced cheque be filed against me personally?", "answer": "Yes. In a proprietorship, the firm and the proprietor are legally the same entity. A case for a bounced cheque issued from the firm's account will be filed against both the firm (represented by the proprietor) and you as the proprietor who is personally liable for the firm's debts.", "legal_terms": ["Proprietorship", "Liability", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
{"question": "The seller supplied goods without any invoice. Now they are claiming a huge amount. Do I have to pay?", "answer": "A seller must provide an invoice or bill as proof of sale and the amount due. Without an invoice or a statement of account, it is very difficult for them to prove the transaction and the liability. The burden is on them to prove the debt, and a lack of invoices severely weakens their case.", "legal_terms": ["Invoice", "Burden of Proof", "Recovery of Money"]}
{"question": "A seller is claiming interest on a payment that's been due for a long time. Is this valid if it's a commercial transaction?", "answer": "In commercial transactions, even if there is no express contract for interest, courts may award 'pendente lite' (during the suit) and future interest at a reasonable rate (e.g., 12% per annum). This is because in business, delayed payment means a loss of capital for the seller.", "legal_terms": ["Interest", "Commercial Transaction", "Pendente Lite Interest"]}
{"question": "My supplier is based in Bangalore, but they delivered defective goods to me in Kerala. Can I file a suit in Kerala?", "answer": "Yes, you can likely file a suit in Kerala. The 'cause of action' arises where the offer was made, where the acceptance was communicated, where the goods were delivered, or where payment was made. Since the goods were delivered to you in Kerala, a part of the cause of action arose there, giving Kerala courts jurisdiction.", "legal_terms": ["Jurisdiction", "Cause of Action", "Place of Delivery"]}
{"question": "The seller admits in court that they sometimes issue credit notes for defective goods. How does this admission help my case?", "answer": "This admission strengthens your argument that it was a standard business practice between you to get credit for defective goods. It supports your claim that your current request for a refund or credit for defective items is reasonable and consistent with your past dealings.", "legal_terms": ["Admission", "Course of Dealing", "Evidence", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "Is a contract for 'sale or return' of goods a final sale?", "answer": "No, it is a conditional sale. In a 'sale or return' contract, the ownership of the goods does not pass to you (the buyer) until you signify your approval or acceptance to the seller, or do an act adopting the transaction (like reselling them). Until then, you can return the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Sale or Return", "Conditional Sale"]}
{"question": "A seller is trying to use a previous statement I made in another case against me. Is this allowed?", "answer": "Yes, a statement or admission made by you in a previous legal proceeding (like a petition or affidavit) can be used as evidence against you in a current case. It is considered an admission, and you would be 'estopped' from denying it unless you can provide a very strong explanation.", "legal_terms": ["Admission", "Estoppel", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "I was forced to pay compensation to my customers because of defective parts from my supplier. Can I recover this from the supplier?", "answer": "Yes, you can file a claim against your supplier for the damages you had to pay to your customers. You must prove that the supplier's defective parts were the direct cause of the problem, and that the compensation you paid was a reasonable and foreseeable consequence of that defect.", "legal_terms": ["Damages", "Indemnity", "Causation", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "What is a 'running account' in a business transaction?", "answer": "A 'running account' is a continuous account between a buyer and seller with a series of transactions (debits and credits). Payments are not typically tied to specific invoices but are made against the overall balance. For limitation purposes, the time limit to sue for the balance due often starts from the date of the last transaction or payment.", "legal_terms": ["Running Account", "Open Account", "Limitation Act"]}
{"question": "The seller did not supply C-Forms for an inter-state purchase. Can they charge me the full tax rate?", "answer": "Yes. In inter-state sales, a concessional tax rate is applicable only if the buyer furnishes the required C-Form to the seller. If you fail to provide the C-Form, the seller is liable to pay the full, non-concessional rate of tax and can legally recover that difference from you.", "legal_terms": ["C-Form", "Central Sales Tax Act", "Inter-state Sale"]}
{"question": "A company I bought goods from is a private limited company. Who is legally responsible if the goods are defective?", "answer": "The legal entity responsible is the private limited company itself, not its directors or shareholders personally. You would file a complaint or suit against 'M/s. [Company Name] Pvt. Ltd.' The company is a separate legal person and is liable for its own debts and obligations.", "legal_terms": ["Private Limited Company", "Separate Legal Entity", "Liability"]}
{"question": "I am being sued by a company, but the person who signed the complaint is just a GPA holder, not a director. Is the case valid?", "answer": "Yes, the case is likely valid. A company can authorize a GPA (General Power of Attorney) holder to represent it and file legal complaints on its behalf. As long as there is a valid GPA or a board resolution authorizing that person, the complaint is maintainable.", "legal_terms": ["General Power of Attorney (GPA)", "Authorization", "Maintainability"]}
{"question": "Can a seller who supplied defective goods win a cheque bounce case against me?", "answer": "It is possible. When you issue a cheque, the law presumes it's for a valid debt. To win, you must rebut this presumption by proving, with strong evidence, that the goods were defective and that you therefore owed nothing or a lesser amount. If you fail to prove the defect, the seller can win the cheque bounce case.", "legal_terms": ["Negotiable Instruments Act", "Presumption of Liability", "Rebuttal", "Defective Goods"]}
{"question": "I sent a reply to a legal notice denying liability for a bounced cheque. Will this help my case?", "answer": "Yes, sending a timely reply to a legal notice is very important. It allows you to state your defense (e.g., defective goods) at the earliest opportunity. If you don't reply, the court might assume that you had no defense at that time and that your later claims are an afterthought.", "legal_terms": ["Legal Notice", "Reply", "Defense", "Afterthought"]}
{"question": "The seller is suing me over four invoices, but I only made a part payment. Does that mean I've accepted all four invoices?", "answer": "Not necessarily. A part payment, unless specified otherwise, is usually applied to the oldest outstanding debt. It does not automatically mean you have admitted liability for all four invoices, especially if some of them are in dispute due to defective goods.", "legal_terms": ["Part-Payment", "Appropriation of Payments", "Invoice", "Liability"]}
{"question": "The seller I'm in a dispute with had promised to replace defective goods but hasn't. What can I do?", "answer": "A promise to replace defective goods is an admission of the defect. If the seller fails to honor this promise, you can use their communication (emails, letters) as evidence in a consumer complaint or civil suit to enforce the replacement or claim a refund for the value of the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Defective Goods", "Breach of Promise", "Evidence", "Consumer Complaint"]}
{"question": "I bought an electronic item that was 'dead on arrival'. The seller says I have to go to the service center. Is this correct?", "answer": "While the warranty might direct you to a service center for repairs, a product that is defective from the very beginning ('dead on arrival') is a clear case of being supplied a non-functional product. You have a strong case to demand an immediate replacement or full refund directly from the seller, as they failed to provide a merchantable good.", "legal_terms": ["Dead on Arrival (DOA)", "Merchantable Quality", "Defective Goods", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "A seller charged me on an invoice for goods I never received. How can I prove I didn't get them?", "answer": "The burden of proof is on the seller to prove delivery. You can ask them to produce a signed delivery receipt, proof of dispatch from a courier, or transporter's records. Your own inventory records and GST returns (like GSTR-2B which shows inward supplies) can also serve as evidence that you never received the goods.", "legal_terms": ["Proof of Delivery", "Burden of Proof", "Invoice", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "The seller is using a computer-generated ledger as proof against me. Can I challenge it?", "answer": "Yes, you can challenge it. For a computer-generated document to be admissible as evidence, it must be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act. You can also challenge its accuracy by pointing out discrepancies, showing it was created much later, or by presenting your own, more reliable, set of accounts.", "legal_terms": ["Electronic Evidence", "Section 65B Certificate", "Ledger Account", "Admissibility"]}
{"question": "The seller agreed to settle our dispute for a lower amount, but then backed out. Can I enforce the settlement?", "answer": "If the settlement was just a verbal discussion, it is very hard to enforce. However, if you have a written agreement, signed minutes of a meeting, or a clear email exchange confirming the settlement terms, you can present this to the court as a concluded agreement that should be honored.", "legal_terms": ["Settlement Agreement", "Enforceability", "Concluded Contract", "Evidence"]}
{"question": "My business reputation has suffered because of a supplier's faulty products. Can I claim compensation for this loss of goodwill?", "answer": "Claiming for loss of reputation or goodwill is considered a claim for 'indirect' or 'consequential' damages. It is often difficult to prove and quantify. Unless your contract with the supplier specifically allows for such claims, courts are generally hesitant to award compensation for reputational damage in a standard commercial dispute.", "legal_terms": ["Goodwill", "Consequential Damages", "Reputation", "Damages"]}
{"question": "In a legal dispute, who has the 'burden of proof' when it comes to defective goods?", "answer": "Initially, the burden of proof is on you, the buyer, to establish a prima facie case that the goods are defective. You must provide some evidence. Once you do that, the burden can shift to the seller to prove that the goods were not defective or that the defect was your fault.", "legal_terms": ["Burden of Proof", "Evidence Act", "Defective Goods", "Prima Facie"]}
{"question": "What is the difference between a warranty and a guarantee?", "answer": "Legally, a 'warranty' is a promise that the goods are of a certain quality, and a breach of warranty usually entitles you to damages (like repair or compensation). A 'guarantee' is a stronger promise, and a breach can sometimes allow you to reject the goods entirely and get a full replacement or refund. However, the terms are often used interchangeably, and the specific wording in your contract is what matters most.", "legal_terms": ["Warranty", "Guarantee", "Breach of Contract", "Remedy"]}
{"question": "Can I return goods if they don't match the description, even if they are not technically broken?", "answer": "Yes. Under the Sale of Goods Act, there is an implied condition that the goods must correspond with the description under which they were sold. If you ordered a specific model or type and received something different, you have the right to reject the goods, as this is a breach of a fundamental condition of the contract.", "legal_terms": ["Sale of Goods Act", "Sale by Description", "Breach of Condition", "Right to Reject"]}
{"question": "I'm a small business owner. Can I file a complaint in a Consumer Court?", "answer": "Yes, you can. A small business owner who buys goods can be considered a 'consumer' as long as the goods are not for a 'commercial purpose' of large-scale resale. If you buy goods for self-employment or to use in your own business (like a printer for your office), you are eligible to file a complaint in the Consumer Court.", "legal_terms": ["Consumer", "Commercial Purpose", "Consumer Protection Act"]}
{"question": "The seller is trying to avoid liability by saying their contract has an 'entire agreement clause'. What does this mean?", "answer": "An 'entire agreement clause' means that only the terms written within the formal contract are legally binding. It prevents either party from making claims based on verbal promises, emails, or discussions that happened during negotiations but were not included in the final signed contract. It aims to ensure that the written contract is the complete and final agreement.", "legal_terms": ["Entire Agreement Clause", "Contract Interpretation", "Parol Evidence Rule"]}
{"question": "Is an oral agreement to supply goods legally valid?", "answer": "Yes, an oral agreement is legally valid and enforceable under the Indian Contract Act. However, it is extremely difficult to prove in court. Without any written evidence like emails, purchase orders, or invoices, the existence and terms of the agreement become a matter of 'he said, she said', which makes legal action very challenging.", "legal_terms": ["Oral Agreement", "Indian Contract Act", "Evidence", "Burden of Proof"]}
{"question": "The seller took a cheque from me but is delaying its presentation in the bank. Is there a time limit?", "answer": "Yes, a cheque is valid for three months from the date written on it. The seller (payee) must present it to the bank within this period. If they fail to do so, the cheque becomes 'stale' and the bank will not honor it.", "legal_terms": ["Cheque Validity", "Stale Cheque", "Negotiable Instruments Act"]}
